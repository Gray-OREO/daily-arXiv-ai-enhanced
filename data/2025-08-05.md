### [1] [Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852)
*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于transformers的上下文引导熵模型（CGT），通过改进时空上下文建模，降低了计算复杂度和熵建模时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件熵模型在利用时空上下文时存在计算复杂度高和空间依赖顺序建模不足的问题。

Method: 设计了时间上下文重采样器和师生网络的空间上下文分配器，分别优化时间信息提取和空间依赖顺序建模。

Result: CGT模型减少了65%的熵建模时间，BD-Rate降低了11%，优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: CGT通过高效时空上下文建模，显著提升了熵模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

### [2] [On-the-Fly Object-aware Representative Point Selection in Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01980)
*Xiaoyu Zhang,Ziwei Wang,Hai Dong,Zhifeng Bao,Jiajun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种点云降采样框架，通过保留关键对象信息并过滤背景点，解决了自动驾驶数据存储和处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成的点云数据量大，存储和处理成本高，需要有效降采样方法。

Method: 包括对象存在检测（无监督和分类器结合）和采样预算分配策略。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上优于现有方法，高效且有效。

Conclusion: 方法通用且可扩展，适用于多种下游模型。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

### [3] [GaussianCross: Cross-modal Self-supervised 3D Representation Learning via Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02172)
*Lei Yao,Yi Wang,Yi Zhang,Moyun Liu,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GaussianCross的跨模态自监督3D表示学习架构，通过整合3D高斯泼溅技术，解决了现有方法中点云表示不足的问题，并在多个基准测试中展示了优异的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有自监督预训练方法在点云表示上存在模型崩溃和结构信息缺失的问题，导致性能不佳，因此提出GaussianCross以解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过3D高斯泼溅技术将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并引入三属性自适应蒸馏泼溅模块构建3D特征场，以捕获多模态特征。

Result: 在ScanNet等基准测试中表现出色，参数和数据效率高，全微调精度显著提升（如9.3% mIoU和6.1% AP$_{50}$）。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过创新架构解决了点云表示问题，验证了其有效性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

### [5] [Learning Partially-Decorrelated Common Spaces for Ad-hoc Video Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02340)
*Fan Hu,Zijie Xin,Xirong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习部分去相关共同空间的方法LPD，用于解决Ad-hoc Video Search任务中视频多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS)任务中，视频的视觉多样性是一个主要挑战，现有方法忽略了多样空间的必要性。

Method: LPD通过为每个视频和文本特征学习单独的共同空间，并引入去相关损失和基于熵的多空间三元组排序损失。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS benchmarks上验证了LPD的有效性，并能增强结果多样性。

Conclusion: LPD成功地提升了视频搜索的多样性和检索效果。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and
increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research
trends such as developing more efficient algorithms and integrating multimedia
technologies to improve the performance of recognition systems in real-world
environments and expand their applications.

### [7] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HoneyImage的新方法，用于验证图像识别模型中数据集的版权归属，通过选择性修改少量困难样本以嵌入可验证的痕迹，同时保持数据集完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于图像数据集可能包含敏感或专有内容，数据所有者需要可靠机制来验证其数据是否被未经授权用于训练第三方模型。现有方法在验证有效性和数据完整性之间存在固有权衡。

Method: HoneyImage通过选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入难以察觉但可验证的痕迹，实现版权验证。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage实现了高验证准确率，且对下游任务性能影响极小。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用的版权保护机制，有助于安全共享数据并发挥数据驱动AI的全部潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

### [8] [Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00896)
*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一个基于相位分数控制的一阶段去噪扩散框架，用于联合生成金属合金的显微结构图像及其分割掩码，显著提高了分割准确性，尤其是在少数类别上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学**​习在金属显微结构分割中的效果受限于人类标注的相位掩码稀缺，尤其是对稀有或复杂形态的合金。

Method: PF-DiffSeg通过全局相位分数向量条件化，生成结构一致且成分有效的显微结构图像和掩码样本，提升数据多样性和训练效率。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法在分割准确性上优于标准增强策略和两阶段掩码引导扩散及GAN基线，同时减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg将生成和条件化集成到统一框架中，为金属显微应用提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一个自监督预训练框架，专门为学习时空信息而设计，尤其适用于循环模型。它通过长事件序列预训练，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件数据自监督学习方法忽视时间信息，仅适用于前馈模型，而循环模型在时间相关任务中潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出TESPEC框架，采用掩码图像建模方法，设计新重建目标——累积事件为伪灰度视频，要求模型推理长期事件历史。

Result: 在对象检测、语义分割和深度估计任务中取得最先进成果。

Conclusion: TESPEC通过有效利用长时间事件序列，显著提升循环模型的性能。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

Conclusion: CCRA有效解决了注意力机制不协调问题，提升了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Conclusion: ROVI通过创新的标注方法提升了文本到图像生成的质量和多样性，为未来研究提供了有价值的数据集和流程。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

Motivation: 解决如何基于眼动追踪数据自动评估人类专家的视觉任务表现，为动态调整人机协作中的专家分配提供支持。

Method: 提出AutoSIGHT系统，基于眼动追踪数据的特征集成分类专家与非专家。

Result: 在5秒评估窗口下AUROC为0.751，30秒窗口下提升至0.8306。

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT为动态人机协作中专家评估提供了可行方案，并开放了眼动追踪数据集。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts

*Muhammad Zeeshan,Umer Zaki,Syed Ahmed Pasha,Zaar Khizar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了增量式SfM管道的详细实现，重点研究了几何估计的一致性和通过捆绑调整进行迭代优化的效果，并验证了其在稀疏数据集中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球SfM技术依赖完整的图像连接且对噪声或缺数据敏感，增量式SfM则为稀疏或部分重叠数据集提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 详细实现了增量式SfM管道，通过逐步添加新视图来恢复场景结构和相机运动，并利用捆绑调整进行迭代优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了方法的重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性，表明其在视觉结构化环境中具有实用性。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种可靠的稀疏3D重建方法，尤其适用于视觉结构化环境。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

### [17] [Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Anomaly Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01045)
*Theo Di Piazza,Carole Lazarus,Olivier Nempont,Loic Boussel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图的方法，通过将CT扫描建模为结构化图，增强多标签异常分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查的增加，需要自动化方法辅助放射科医生应对繁重的工作量，但现有方法在建模长距离依赖或计算成本上存在局限。

Method: 采用图结构建模CT扫描，利用轴向切片三元组节点并通过谱域卷积处理，提升分类性能。

Result: 方法在多标签分类任务中表现优异，具有跨数据集泛化能力，并对z轴平移具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的图方法在CT扫描多标签分类中有效且高效，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

*Hongyu Zhu,Sichu Liang,Wenwen Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Fangqi Li,Shi-Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的逃避框架，通过教师模型学习版权数据集，再通过OOD数据集将任务相关知识转移到学生模型中，从而高效逃避数据集所有权验证（DOV）。实验表明该方法优于现有攻击方法，同时揭示了DOV方法的关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现代深度学习模型依赖大规模数据集，但许多数据集受到版权或隐私限制。DOV虽被用于保护数据集版权，但其评估过于简化，导致虚假安全感。本研究旨在揭示DOV漏洞并提出更高效的逃避方法。

Method: 通过教师模型学习版权数据集，利用OOD数据集将任务相关知识转移到学生模型，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型筛选最优子集，实现任务导向知识的选择性转移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能完全消除版权标识符，在泛化性和逃避效果上优于九种现有攻击方法，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调了其长期发展的必要性以提高实用性。该方法为DOV的进一步改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamSat-2.0通过评估三种3D重建模型在航天器和小行星数据集上的性能，发现模型表现与领域相关，其中Hunyuan-3D在航天器图像质量和小行星几何精度上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升小行星探索和自主航天器导航能力，为相关领域提供更高效的3D重建工具。

Method: 使用2D感知（图像质量）和3D几何（形状精度）指标，系统评估Hunyuan-3D、Trellis-3D和Ouroboros-3D在自定义数据集上的表现。

Result: 模型表现因领域而异，复杂航天器的图像质量更高，而简单小行星的几何重建更优。Hunyuan-3D在航天器图像质量和小行星几何精度上表现最佳。

Conclusion: DreamSat-2.0通过评估建立了新基准，表明3D重建模型的性能与目标领域密切相关，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

### [20] [COSTARR: Consolidated Open Set Technique with Attenuation for Robust Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01087)
*Ryan Rabinowitz,Steve Cruz,Walter Scheirer,Terrance E. Boult*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的衰减假设和COSTARR方法，通过结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺乏，显著提升了开放集识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉识别系统中处理新颖性是一个关键挑战，现有方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减信息的作用。

Method: 提出衰减假设和COSTARR方法，利用训练中学习的小权重衰减特征，结合熟悉特征和陌生特征缺乏的信息。

Result: 实验表明COSTARR在多种架构上表现优异，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息提升了开放集识别能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces AURA, a novel hybrid spatiotemporal-chromatic framework
designed for robust, real-time detection and classification of industrial smoke
emissions. The framework addresses critical limitations of current monitoring
systems, which often lack the specificity to distinguish smoke types and
struggle with environmental variability. AURA leverages both the dynamic
movement patterns and the distinct color characteristics of industrial smoke to
provide enhanced accuracy and reduced false positives. This framework aims to
significantly improve environmental compliance, operational safety, and public
health outcomes by enabling precise, automated monitoring of industrial
emissions.

*Yuekun Dai,Haitian Li,Shangchen Zhou,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Trans-Adapter的即插即用适配器，能够直接处理透明图像，解决了传统两阶段管道在透明图像修复中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，而传统的透明图像修复方法难以保持编辑区域的透明度一致性并在透明度边界产生锯齿边缘。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持基于扩散的修复模型直接处理透明图像，并可无缝集成ControlNet进行可控编辑。

Result: 通过引入LayerBench和新评估指标，实验证明了该方法在透明边缘质量上的有效性。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MASIV是首个基于视觉的材料不可知系统识别框架，通过学习神经本构模型推断物体动力学，无需依赖特定材料先验，解决了现有方法无法处理未知材料的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义材料先验，无法适应未知材料。本文提出无需材料先验的系统识别方法。

Method: 使用可学习的神经本构模型，并通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供密集几何引导，优化稳定性。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MASIV验证了无需材料先验的系统识别可行性，并为复杂场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 探索多种策略（监督微调、强化学习、链式思维推理）以提升广泛图像编辑任务的性能，并在统一框架下研究这些组件。

Method: 采用自回归多模态模型统一处理文本和视觉标记，结合强化学习和大型多模态LLM验证器。

Result: 强化学习策略在多模态LLM验证器的支持下效果最佳，EARL模型在多种编辑任务上表现优异，且训练数据需求较低。

Conclusion: EARL推进了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑中的应用前沿，相关代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于第一人称视角的两种新任务（Egocentric Motion Generation和Egocentric Motion Forecasting）及模型UniEgoMotion，利用扩散模型和头部中心运动表示，解决现有方法在现实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强AR/VR体验、改进人机交互、推动辅助技术和自适应医疗解决方案，需从第一人称视角准确预测和模拟运动。现有方法依赖第三人称和结构化3D场景，无法有效应对现实中的视野限制、遮挡和动态相机问题。

Method: 提出UniEgoMotion，一个统一的基于条件的运动扩散模型，采用头部中心运动表示，支持从第一人称视觉输入重建、预测和生成运动。通过图像提取场景语义，无需显式3D场景。

Result: UniEgoMotion在运动重建任务中表现优异，首次实现从单张第一人称图像生成运动。EE4D-Motion数据集为训练提供了支持。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新标准，为相关应用开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑MRI数据异常检测中的大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡问题，同时探索方法在跨领域应用中的潜力。

Method: 结合DRL与特征表示，处理标签稀缺问题，使用公开脑MRI数据集（IXI和BraTS 2021）进行训练和测试，预处理包括归一化和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上像素级AUROC为88.7%，图像级为96.7%；在工业数据集上像素级AUROC为99.8%，图像级为99.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于实际临床和工业应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DC3的数据集压缩框架，通过颜色补偿提升压缩图像的质量，解决了现有方法在效率和语义保真度上的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法面临性能与保真度的权衡问题，作者发现颜色在语义表达中的作用被忽视，因此提出通过颜色补偿提升压缩图像的表现。

Method: DC3框架采用校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像的颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: 实验表明DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且能够用压缩数据集微调预训练扩散模型，FID结果表明其可行且无性能下降。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿有效提升数据集压缩的性能和语义保真度，并在下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Result: 在3D mIoU上提升17%，场景重建与交互表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在开放词汇场景理解与交互中表现出色，方法有效且实用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了个性化安全对齐（PSA）框架，用于在文本到图像扩散模型中根据用户偏好调整安全行为，解决了现有方法忽略用户多样性需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的文本到图像扩散模型采用统一的安全标准，未能考虑用户因年龄、心理健康和个人信仰等因素形成的多样化安全边界。

Method: 提出了PSA框架，通过将个性化用户配置文件整合到扩散过程中，并结合跨注意力机制调整模型行为，同时保持图像质量。

Result: PSA在抑制有害内容和与用户约束对齐方面优于现有方法，获得了更高的Win Rate和Pass Rate分数。

Conclusion: PSA提供了一种有效的方法，使生成模型能够更好地满足用户个性化安全需求，且实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: LawDIS是一个基于语言窗口的可控二分图像分割框架，通过语言提示和窗口细化策略生成高质量对象掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化需求上的不足，提升分割精度。

Method: 结合语言控制的初始分割（LS）和窗口控制的细化（WR）策略，利用扩散模型生成掩码。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，Fβω指标提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS通过灵活的用户控制和协同策略，实现了高精度和个性化的图像分割。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

### [31] [TEACH: Text Encoding as Curriculum Hints for Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01153)
*Xiahan Yang,Hui Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEACH是一种新的训练范式，通过将真实文本作为辅助输入注入模型，并逐步减少其影响，实现从依赖标签学习到完全视觉识别的过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因复杂视觉表现和有限语义先验，Scene Text Recognition (STR)仍具挑战性。

Method: 编码目标标签到嵌入空间，应用损失感知掩码，无需外部预训练或引入推理开销。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，TEACH显著提高了模型准确率，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: TEACH具有模型无关性，能无缝集成至现有编码器-解码器框架，验证了其鲁棒性和普适性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新算法，通过粗到细策略和优化特征计算，显著加速了视频中的密集长期3D点跟踪，速度提升5-100倍，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大量轨迹时计算成本高，尤其是基于transformer的迭代跟踪和特征计算成为瓶颈。

Method: 采用粗到细策略逐步扩展跟踪轨迹，并提出可学习的插值模块初始化新轨迹；优化特征计算以减少成本。

Result: 算法实现5-100倍速度提升，同时保持最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 新算法有效解决了计算瓶颈，显著提升了密集3D点跟踪的效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角稀疏图像中缺乏真实相机姿态的问题，提供一种高效且无需姿态监督的3D重建与视角合成方法。

Method: 采用共享特征提取主干网络，单步前馈预测3D高斯基元和相机姿态，结合渲染损失和重投影损失优化几何约束。

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成中表现最优，并在相对姿态估计中超越基于几何先验的方法。

Conclusion: SPFSplat以其高效性和优越性能，展示了无需姿态监督的3D高斯泼溅的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过学习感知3D物体功能区域并分阶段推理来解决物体操作中的功能区域定位与分类问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理3D功能区域定位与分类时往往分开进行，导致预测不一致且无法完整预测功能区域，也无法适应不同尺度变化。

Method: 提出一种基于跨模态3D表征和分阶段推理的方法，融合多尺度几何特征，并通过两阶段预测机制耦合定位与分类任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在功能区域定位和分类任务上均表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效建模任务依赖性和多尺度处理，显著提升了功能区域理解的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Conclusion: 提出的3D占用接地基准和模型能够更精确地感知物体，为自动驾驶中的空间感知提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来快速、经济地评估路面网络提供了新途径。

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RoadMamba的新方法，结合Mamba架构的全局感知和局部纹理提取能力，用于道路表面分类任务，并通过实验验证其在大型数据集上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉技术获取道路表面条件信息对自动驾驶车辆的安全性和舒适性至关重要。现有Mamba架构在视觉处理任务中表现优异，但在道路表面分类中因缺乏有效的局部纹理提取能力而表现不佳。

Method: 采用双状态空间模型（DualSSM）来提取全局语义和局部纹理，通过双注意力融合（DAF）解码和融合双特征，并引入双辅助损失以避免网络仅依赖全局信息。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大型道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合全局和局部感知能力，成功解决了现有Mamba架构在道路表面分类任务中的局限性，展现了其潜力。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StyDeco的无监督框架，通过专门为风格迁移任务学习的文本表示，解决了扩散模型在风格迁移中的语义差距问题。该框架结合了先验引导数据蒸馏（PGD）和对比语义解耦（CSD），显著提升了风格保真度和结构保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在风格迁移中表现优异，但其文本驱动机制忽略了文本描述的非空间性与视觉风格的空间属性之间的语义差距，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: StyDeco框架采用PGD蒸馏无监督的风格知识，利用冻结生成模型自动合成伪配对数据；随后通过CSD任务特定目标调整文本编码器，进行语义空间的双类聚类。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法，并支持独特的去风格化过程。

Conclusion: StyDeco通过专门设计的文本表示和任务目标，有效解决了风格迁移中的语义问题，具有较高的实用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

TL;DR: 摘要提出了一种利用视觉场景上下文提升楼层平面定位（FLoc）的方法，通过无监督学习和聚类约束预训练房间辨别器，注入场景上下文信息以减少定位模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面因重复结构导致定位模糊，现有方法忽视视觉图像的丰富上下文信息，本文希望通过利用更广的场景上下文提升定位准确性。

Method: 提出无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间辨别器，提取房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法。

Result: 在标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 利用视觉场景上下文可有效减少楼层平面定位的模糊性，提升定位性能。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯的渲染，但网格与图像的对齐问题导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: 提出Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry模块和Latent Texture Attention机制，动态优化几何和纹理。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在高保真头部重建和新视角合成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MoGaFace有效解决了网格对齐问题，提升了3D头部重建的精度和实用性。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的成功依赖于梯度优化，但这一过程常导致权重结构混乱，影响特征清晰性和学习动态。本文旨在通过新架构解决这一根本性问题。

Method: 提出了ENN架构，通过层共享学习正交特征基重构权重，强制权重动态解耦和对齐，同时开发了无需反向传播的高效训练变体ENN-ℓ。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优异，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中设定了新基准。ENN-ℓ实现2倍以上训练加速，且精度超越传统反向传播。

Conclusion: ENN通过直接解决反向传播的表示缺陷，提供了一种性能更强、效率更高的并行训练范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效内存和低延迟优势。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但低熵样本在分布偏移下不可靠，无法保证类内紧凑性，因此需改进原型构建方式。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存（低熵样本初始化原型）、对齐缓存（视觉与文本信息整合以紧凑类内分布）和负缓存（高熵样本校准预测）。MCP++框架进一步引入跨模态原型对齐与残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务中，所提方法与框架实现了最优的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过多缓存设计与原型残差微调，MCP++显著提升了测试时间适应的性能，解决了原型构建的不可靠性问题。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多视图开放集学习中的模糊性和偏置问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过生成与问题相关的图像描述来减少大规模视觉语言模型（LVLM）的计算成本，同时避免视觉信息丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模视觉语言模型的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在去除冗余标记时会导致严重的视觉信息丢失。

Method: ACCM包含轻量级的描述生成模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成与用户指令相关的图像描述，并选择最佳描述进行补偿。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM显著优于现有方法，计算成本更低（如FLOPs减少6.5%时性能提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM能有效降低LVLMs的计算成本，同时保持高性能，展示了自监督学习的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出NS-Net框架，通过NULL-Space投影和对比学习解决CLIP特征在高层次语义信息上的局限性，提升AI生成图像的检测能力，泛化性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型（如GANs和扩散模型）的快速发展导致高度逼真的图像被滥用，现有检测器对未知生成模型的泛化能力不足，尤其是在真实与伪造图像语义内容相近时。

Method: 提出NS-Net框架，利用NULL-Space投影从CLIP视觉特征中解耦语义信息，结合对比学习捕捉真实与生成图像的分布差异，并通过Patch Selection保留细粒度伪影。

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net的检测准确率比现有方法提高7.4%，展现出对GAN和扩散模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: NS-Net通过解耦语义与视觉特征，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化性能，为安全敏感领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Motivation: 现有面部解析方法依赖昂贵且耗时的密集像素级标注，为降低标注成本，论文引入了弱监督方法，仅需弱标注即可完成任务。

Method: 提出的DisFaceRep框架通过显式和隐式机制分离共现面部组件，包括共现组件解耦策略和文本引导的解耦损失。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上的实验验证了DisFaceRep的有效性，性能显著优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: WSFP任务具有挑战性，DisFaceRep通过解耦表示方法成功解决了共现组件的模糊性问题，展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于跨模态语义一致性的自增强框架，用于图像聚类，通过联合优化视觉编码器和聚类头提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法冻结CLIP等预训练模型的编码器，导致任务无关表示与聚类需求不匹配，限制了性能。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段通过跨模态语义一致性训练轻量级聚类头；第二阶段利用伪标签自增强微调视觉编码器。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型可媲美更大ViT-L/14的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 自增强框架有效打破预训练模型在聚类任务中的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STDNet的新型时空差异网络，通过空间和时间差异分支解决视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率中存在显著的长尾分布问题，主要表现在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域，需要针对性的解决方案。

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支。空间差异分支通过动态对齐RGB特征与学习到的空间差异表示来解决空间长尾问题；时间差异分支利用相邻帧的RGB和深度信息进行时间差异补偿。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，STDNet表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet通过有效的时空差异处理，成功解决了视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有的数据集蒸馏方法在图像分辨率或每类图像数量增加时性能下降，且扩散模型生成的图像多样性不足，导致蒸馏数据集信息冗余。

Method: 提出了ACS方法，将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗性损失引导扩散采样过程，挑战基于采样图像训练的判别器，从而减少课程间的信息重叠并提高多样性。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k数据集上分别实现了4.1%和2.1%的性能提升。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗性引导的课程采样，有效提高了蒸馏数据集的多样性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为评估点云分类模型的鲁棒性和不确定性建模能力提供了有效工具，Point Transformer v3在校准能力上表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

Conclusion: SGCap 通过建模时序和语义多样性显著提升零样本视频描述效果，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型容易生成不适当内容（如暴力或露骨图像），而传统的防御方法依赖大规模数据集且静态调整，导致高计算成本和图像质量下降，无法适应多样化的安全需求。

Method: PromptSafe通过将不安全提示重写为安全版本，构建文本训练语料库，优化通用软提示，并结合门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe在多个基准测试中表现出色，实现了2.36%的不安全生成率，同时保持了高良性保真度，并能泛化到未见过的有害类别。

Conclusion: PromptSafe为解决T2I模型的安全问题提供了高效、可扩展的方案，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准测试中，该方法在无监督立体匹配方法中达到了最优精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无监督立体匹配中的模糊性问题，并通过几何知识迁移显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Conclusion: UgDA是一种有效的跨域数据增强方法，能显著改善立体匹配模型的性能，且易于集成到现有网络中。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上平均AUROC分别为66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD能够持续学习并适应新类别，在多类3D异常检测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态注意力感知融合架构，用于解决远端肌病的诊断挑战，结合全局和局部特征提升分类准确性和可解释性，但解剖特异性和临床实用性仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远端肌病诊断复杂，现有方法在可解释性和性能上存在局限，需要更高效的融合策略。

Method: 通过注意力门机制融合两种深度学习模型（全局和局部特征），并进行定量和定性评估。

Result: 在BUSI和专有数据集上取得高分类准确性，生成临床相关显着图，但解剖特异性不足。

Conclusion: 需开发更丰富的上下文感知解释方法和临床反馈，以满足实际诊断需求。

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CSINet的并行统一分割框架，通过跨视图语义交互网络解决现有方法在处理微小模糊目标时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理遥感图像分割时，仅使用全图像作为输入，并在传统单视图结构中嵌套跨尺度信息交互技术，对视觉突出的目标有效，但对微小模糊目标表现不佳。

Method: CSINet通过跨视图窗口注意力模块（CVWin）在编码阶段补充全局和局部语义，协同预测远程和近程视觉线索，并使用协作扩张注意力增强解码器（CDAD）整合跨视图多尺度特征。

Result: 该方法显著提升了性能，同时保持了较高的速度。

Conclusion: CSINet通过有效利用全局和局部语义，解决了遥感图像分割中微小模糊目标的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Motivation: 减少对标注皮肤病数据集的依赖，提供可扩展的诊断支持工具。

Method: 通过生成性编辑合成无红斑的参考图像，并与原始图像对齐，结合颜色空间分析检测红斑。

Result: 初步实验成功分离面部红斑，性能优于基于阈值的基线方法。

Conclusion: 生成扩散模型与统计颜色分割的结合为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供了高效的红斑检测方法。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的广泛应用导致个人艺术作品被未经授权使用，现有保护方法效果有限，需要更好的版权保护方案。

Method: 采用语义自重建增强风格表达，多层级特征融合编码为风格指纹，通过最小包围超球边界建模风格。

Result: 实验显示StyleSentinel在单样本验证任务上表现优异，并在在线平台上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel提供了一种有效的版权保护方法，解决了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

TL;DR: ViLaCo提出了一个视觉-语言协作推理框架，通过预训练视觉-语言模型引入辅助语义监督，仅使用图像级标签即可实现精确的像素级伪造定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督图像伪造定位方法主要依赖图像内一致性线索，缺乏外部语义指导，导致定位性能有限。

Method: ViLaCo通过视觉-语言特征建模网络提取文本和视觉先验，自适应推理网络对齐语义与视觉特征，双预测头实现分类与定位，并通过对比块一致性模块增强伪造区分能力。

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入视觉-语言协作推理框架，有效解决了弱监督下语义指导不足的问题，显著提升了伪造定位能力。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频OCL方法忽略了下一帧特征的整合和过渡动态的学习，导致查询预测效果不佳。

Method: 设计了新的transitioner，整合槽位和特征，并通过对随机采样的槽位-特征对进行训练，学习过渡动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对象发现上提升了10个百分点，达到新的SOTA，并有利于下游任务如动态建模。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q通过改进transitioner设计和动态学习，显著提升了视频OCL性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Conclusion: 通过VLM生成多样化数据，有望改善灾后损害评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: FWA机制有效解决了计算饱和问题，LOLViT展示了轻量级混合主干网络在性能和效率上的显著优势。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Motivation: 现有的数字地形图（DTM）生成方法（如多视图立体管道）通常繁琐且需要大量手动图像预处理。为了克服这些限制，作者希望利用神经体积渲染技术直接从卫星图像学习地形图。

Method: 提出的方法为神经地形图（NTM），仅需每个图像像素的轨迹信息，不依赖深度或其他结构先验。方法在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上进行了测试。

Result: 实验表明，NTM的输出地形图精度接近于卫星图像分辨率，即使在不完美的相机内外参数下表现依然良好。

Conclusion: 神经地形图（NTM）方法展示了直接从卫星图像生成高质量DTM的潜力，为行星探索任务提供了更高效的地形图生成方案。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究为开放世界中基于属性的人物检索提供了新思路和解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW数据，难以有效恢复被抑制的细节，而频率域可以自然分离物体轮廓和纹理等特征。

Method: 提出SFAE框架，包括频率带的空间化、跨域融合注意力模块和自适应非线性调整。

Result: 通过结合空间和频率表示，SFAE能更好地恢复RAW图像中被抑制的细节。

Conclusion: SFAE展示了在RAW数据物体检测中结合空间和频率域的有效性。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForenX是一种基于多模态大语言模型的方法，不仅能检测AI生成图像的真伪，还能提供符合人类认知的解释。通过引入专门的取证提示和ForgReason数据集，显著提升了检测的泛化能力和解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法与人类认知取证分析之间存在差距，ForenX旨在填补这一空白，提供更直观的解释能力。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）分析取证线索，并结合专门的取证提示优化检测能力；同时引入LLM与人工标注协作生成的ForgReason数据集。

Result: ForenX在两个主要基准测试中表现优异，其解释能力通过主观评估得到验证，且少量人工标注显著提升了解释质量。

Conclusion: ForenX在AI生成图像检测中实现了高泛化能力和高质量解释，为未来取证分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

*Shitian Yang,Deyu Li,Xiaoke Jiang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DRot是一种即插即用的增强方法，通过旋转和镜像图像来提升3D任务的性能，同时保持几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵且增强工具少的问题。

Method: 通过旋转和镜像图像，同步更新RGB图像、相机参数和3D标注，保持投影几何一致性。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提高了3D检测的性能指标。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种高效且可转移到其他3D任务的增强方法。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

TL;DR: SPECTRUM是一个时频协同模型，通过多域表示学习提升在线手写验证（OHV）性能，结合时间与频率特征，显著超越传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多域表示学习在手写验证中的潜力，解决传统仅依赖时间特征的局限性。

Method: 模型包含多尺度交互器、自门控融合模块和多域距离验证器，实现时频特征的动态整合与判别。

Result: 实验证明SPECTRUM性能优于现有OHV方法，多域学习显著提升判别力。

Conclusion: 多域学习在手写验证中有效，为未来多域研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高光谱图像恢复方法使用固定格式因子表示非局部自相似性张量组，无法适应多样缺失场景，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 模型交替进行粗粒度（基于Tucker张量分解）和细粒度（基于FCTN分解）的分解，以统一表示全局、局部和非局部先验。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在多种缺失场景（如像素和条纹）中表现出优异的恢复效果和广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多粒度分解实现全局、局部和非局部先验的统一表示，显著提升了高光谱图像恢复的效果。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Motivation: 临床应用中缺乏手动标注时，现有分割模型难以评估分割质量，因此需要一种无需真实标注的质量预测方法。

Method: 提出两种互补框架：一种基于预测分割和不确定性图，另一种整合原始图像、不确定性图和预测分割图。采用贝叶斯方法量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 框架具有跨模态鲁棒性，结合多种不确定性指标和可视化分析，显著提升分割质量评估的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Motivation: 当前3D生成主要集中于对象级，场景级生成由于缺乏处理尺度不一致的模型而较少探索。

Method: 提出Can3Tok变分自编码器和数据处理流程，解决3D场景的潜表示学习问题。

Result: 在DL3DV-10K数据集上验证，Can3Tok成功泛化到新场景，而其他方法无法收敛或泛化。

Conclusion: Can3Tok有效地解决了3D场景生成中的挑战，为下游任务提供了基础。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast

interpretability, and generalization.

Result: MiraGe在多个基准测试中表现优异，即使对于Sora等未见过的生成器仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MiraGe通过生成器无关的特征学习，显著提升了对AI生成图像的检测能力，具备较强的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: ReasonAct通过渐进式训练方法，使小型模型在保持计算效率的同时，实现具有竞争力的视频推理性能。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in

However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than

adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间存在平衡问题，尤其是在处理复杂视频内容时。

Method: E-VRAG通过帧预过滤、轻量级VLM评分、全局统计分布检索策略和多视角问答方案，优化计算效率和信息提取能力。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，E-VRAG计算成本降低约70%，且准确性优于基线方法。

Conclusion: E-VRAG无需额外训练即可显著提升视频RAG任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Result: 剪除92.6%的视觉令牌，完全保留基线性能；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线的110%，保持高剪枝率。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器存在冗余扫描和高能耗问题，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 使用轻量级预测网络和可微分掩码生成器，基于历史数据预测关键区域。

Result: 实验表明，能耗降低65%以上，同时保持或优于传统方法的3D检测性能。

Conclusion: 自适应扫描策略有效平衡了能耗与检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion

*Yujia Tong,Tian Zhang,Jingling Yuan,Yuze Wang,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LetheViT 是一种针对 Vision Transformers (ViTs) 的对比性遗忘方法，通过掩码图像输入生成正逻辑损失，原始图像输入生成负逻辑损失，帮助模型忘记特定数据同时保留分类能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户有权撤回数据，需要从训练模型中完全消除数据影响。ViTs 的随机遗忘问题尤为复杂，需在保留模型性能的同时满足隐私合规。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示 ViTs 的特性，提出 LetheViT，结合掩码图像和原始图像生成对比损失，实现遗忘特定样本的目标。

Result: 实验表明 LetheViT 在隐私合规与模型效能之间取得最佳平衡，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: LetheViT 为 ViTs 提供了一种高效的数据遗忘解决方案，满足隐私法规要求。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TopoImages的新方法，通过编码图像局部区域的拓扑结构来增强深度学习模型的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像处理方法通常缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，限制了深度学习在图像分析中的应用潜力，尤其是在医学图像领域。

Method: 利用持续同调（PH）从图像局部区域提取拓扑特征，生成向量化的表示（TopoImages），并通过多视角TopoImages融合原始图像输入深度学习模型。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上的实验表明，TopoImages显著提升了分类准确率，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: TopoImages为图像数据分析提供了新的视角，并能无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，展现了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

*Lingfeng He,De Cheng,Huaijie Wang,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SECA的统一框架，通过利用文本先验的语义丰富性来改进持续学习中的知识迁移和分类器表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，现有方法在知识迁移时未考虑语义相关性，导致任务间干扰和稳定性-可塑性平衡问题；此外，基于文本的分类器泛化性强但可塑性有限，视觉分类器又缺乏精确语义。

Method: 提出SECA框架，包含语义引导的知识迁移模块（SG-AKT）和语义增强的视觉原型优化模块（SE-VPR），分别通过文本线索评估新图像的历史知识相关性，并利用类间语义关系优化视觉原型。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA框架通过结合文本语义丰富性和视觉分类器，显著提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Xinhui Li,Xinyu He,Qiming Hu,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Set Pivot Learning（SPL），一种基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）的新域迁移任务定义，解决了传统域泛化（DG）假设的局限性，并通过动态适应和VFM中心调优提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DG假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但VFMs的出现使这一假设过时。SPL旨在重新定义域迁移任务，以适应当前研究和应用需求。

Method: SPL采用动态适应和VFM中心调优策略，提出动态提示微调方法，结合动态类感知提示和提示引导的特征聚焦器。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，尤其在广义分割任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SPL为基于VFMs的域迁移任务提供了更灵活且有效的解决方案，推动了领域的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STCN的两阶段方法，用于随机和连续的人类运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成连续时空动态和预测随机运动序列时存在挑战，易忽略运动的灵活性并陷入模式崩溃。

Method: 分两阶段：第一阶段提出时空连续网络生成更平滑运动序列；第二阶段利用锚点集学习高斯混合分布并采样以减少类内差异。

Result: 在两个数据集（Human3.6M和HumanEva-I）上表现出在多样性和准确性上的竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN方法有效解决了现有问题，提升了预测效果。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的终身行人重识别方法Pr^2R，通过将历史数据信息压缩到像素空间中，避免存储原始样本，同时有效缓解遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身行人重识别（LReID）在跨域任务中面临数据隐私和知识遗忘的挑战。现有的重放方法需存储历史样本，引发隐私问题；而无需样本的方法又因遗忘知识导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Pr^2R方法，通过将多个真实图像的训练特征压缩到单个图像中，生成具有代表性的压缩样本。在重放阶段，同时对齐当前域与历史域，并调整样本风格以适应当前域。

Result: 实验表明，Pr^2R在基准测试中显著提升了重放效果，隐私保护的同时实现了更高的准确性（比现有方法高4%-6%）。

Conclusion: Pr^2R通过像素级信息压缩和双重对齐策略，解决了隐私保护和知识遗忘问题，为终身行人重识别提供了高效且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

TL;DR: SNARM是一种通过自引用学习增强工业异常检测的新框架，利用测试图像内的动态参考选择，结合Mamba模块实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖预训练的正常数据特征，SNARM通过动态自引用学习提升异常检测的判别能力。

Method: 通过比较测试图像块与训练特征库生成内外残差特征，利用多头部Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如MVTec AD、MVTec 3D、VisA）上取得了SOTA性能，指标全面提升。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自引用学习和Mamba模块的有效结合，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Result: 在五个基准测试中实现最优性能，仅需0.93M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计显著提升了多模态跟踪的效率和性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实临床中多模态医疗数据常存在类别不平衡问题，传统方法易过拟合或欠拟合，难以捕捉跨模态交互，因此需要新方法。

Method: 设计了多模态课程测量器和类别分布引导的训练调度器，使模型逐步适应不平衡分布和复杂类别。

Result: 在多个多模态医疗数据集上，CLIMD优于现有方法，尤其擅长处理不平衡数据。

Conclusion: CLIMD作为即插即用框架，有望提升多模态疾病诊断准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤亚型的细粒度分类因形态细微差异和标注数据稀缺而困难，现有视觉-语言模型在细粒度病理特征捕捉上不足。

Method: FG-PAN框架包含局部特征优化模块（通过空间关系增强局部特征）和细粒度文本生成模块（利用大语言模型生成病理感知的语义原型），通过特征对齐提升分类能力。

Result: 在EBRAINS和TCGA等数据集上，FG-PAN表现优于现有方法，零样本分类效果显著。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过结合局部特征优化和细粒度文本生成，提升了脑肿瘤亚型分类的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的数据集上，分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL框架通过动态调整提示，显著提升了模型对多样化伪造图像的检测性能。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 图像地理定位在危机响应、数字取证和基于位置的情报中具有重要应用，但LLMs在这方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入IMAGEO-Bench基准测试，评估10种先进LLMs（开源和闭源模型）在三个多样数据集上的表现，分析其推理过程和地理偏差。

Result: 闭源模型表现更好，但存在地理偏差（高资源地区性能优于低资源地区），成功定位的关键在于识别城市环境、户外场景和地标。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严谨评估，并为构建地理感知AI系统提供了参考。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical

have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,

Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)

### [104] [Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641)
*Yujian Liu,Yuechuan Lin,Dongxu Shen,Haoran Li,Yutong Wang,Xiaoli Liu,Shidang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CDSR的双尺度重建框架，通过高效选择有信息量的高分辨率补丁，显著提升了WSI分析的性能，降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多实例学习方法在WSI分析中因忽略特征提取器的域差距和补丁依赖性导致性能不佳。需要一种兼顾效率和形态保真度的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段选择性采样策略，结合局部到全局网络进行高分辨率WSI表示重建，减少冗余和依赖性补丁。

Result: 仅需平均9个高分辨率补丁，CDSR在分类任务中准确率提升6.3%，AUC提升5.5%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CDSR在WSI分析中通过高效采样和双尺度重建，实现了高性能和低成本，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型提取通用可操作性知识，能够有效提升3D可操作性锚定的泛化性能。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Conclusion: 语义图级解码策略在减少幻觉问题上具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

TL;DR: 论文提出VELA方法，通过基于点的提示进行显式轮廓演化，实现无模态分割，优于现有强提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无模态分割方法依赖昂贵或不实际的强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），且缺乏几何可解释性。

Method: VELA利用速度驱动的水平集方法，从点输入构建初始水平集函数，并通过全可微分网络预测的形状特定运动场逐步演化。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中，VELA仅需单点提示即超越现有方法。

Conclusion: VELA通过可解释的几何建模在弱提示下实现高效无模态分割，代码将公开。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Method: ShapeMoE学习潜在形状分布空间，将对象路由到适合其形状特征的轻量级专家，每个专家专注于特定形状模式。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上，ShapeMoE优于现有方法，尤其在遮挡区域分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状感知的专家路由实现了高效且高精度的遮挡区域分割。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Motivation: 视觉基础模型在语义分割中面临数据规模不足和域分布偏移的挑战，Rein++ 旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明，Rein++ 在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++ 是一种高效、可泛化且自适应的分割解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Method: 构建PatchMap基准，通过大量前向传播评估补丁效果；提出分段引导放置启发式方法，利用现成分割掩码识别易受攻击区域。

Result: 小补丁（低至图像2%）在热点区域能显著降低模型置信度；分段引导方法在五种架构中攻击成功率提升8~13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap为研究位置感知防御和自适应攻击提供了资源，其方法显著提升了对抗补丁的攻击效果。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

Motivation: 解决Vision-Language Models (VLMs)中的幻觉问题，通过统一视觉通道处理信息。

Method: 在图像中直接嵌入文本指令，移除单独的文本输入。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL的POPE准确性提高了4.1%，LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image能够减少模态间隙，但不同模型对嵌入文本的适应性差异显著。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现出色，但在3D编辑中保持多视图一致性仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过多视图输入微调3D生成器，再通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后使用高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视图输出为3D表示。

Result: DisCo3D在多视图一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D有效解决了3D编辑中的多视图一致性问题，显著提升了编辑质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

Conclusion: PromptReg简化了区域匹配流程，展示了无训练配准的潜力，性能优异且通用性强。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Conclusion: VTG为统一过渡视频生成的研究提供了有效框架，展现了在平滑性和语义一致性上的显著优势。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

TL;DR: LT-Gaussian是一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3D-GS）的地图更新方法，通过多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测和高斯地图更新模块，有效且高效地更新地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶场景中，3D-GS生成的高质量地图因时间和计算成本高昂而难以实时更新，因此需要一种高效的地图更新方法。

Method: LT-Gaussian由多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测模块和高斯地图更新模块组成，通过对比新旧场景数据，实现针对性地图更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，LT-Gaussian能有效处理自动驾驶场景中的常见环境变化，并生成更高质量的重建结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，提供了一种高效且高质量的地图更新解决方案。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

TL;DR: GAID框架通过帧级门控融合和定向自适应语义扰动，提升了文本视频检索的多模态表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖视觉线索，忽略音频语义或采用粗粒度融合，导致多模态表示效果不佳。

Method: 提出帧级门控融合（FGF）和定向自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别实现细粒度对齐和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA效果，并显著提升效率。

Conclusion: GAID通过模块互补，生成更稳定和表达性强的多模态表示。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Conclusion: HateClipSeg为仇恨言论检测提供了更全面的数据集和评估框架，推动了多模态和时间感知技术的发展。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing
datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both
video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments
labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting,
Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results
highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more
sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术机器人需要动态场景的实时理解，但现有静态数据集训练的模型在动态环境中表现不佳，增量学习可以解决这一问题。

Method: 基于TOPICS方法，改进为TOPICS+，引入Dice损失处理类别不平衡，设计分层伪标签和手术专用标签分类体系。

Result: 提出了6个新的增量学习基准和144类标签的数据集，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TOPICS+在手术场景中表现优异，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Motivation: 尽管深度视觉模型表现出色，但由于其表示的分布式特性，定位特定视觉概念的编码位置仍然具有挑战性。

Method: GCC方法通过迭代评估神经元间连接的功能依赖和语义对齐，构建与查询相关的概念电路。

Result: 该方法能够自动发现多个电路，每个电路捕捉查询中的特定概念，为模型提供了细粒度的概念解释。

Conclusion: GCC在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT是一种多目标跟踪方法，通过联合利用外观和运动线索，有效解决了无人机视频中视角变化和运动复杂性带来的跟踪挑战。其核心包括外观-运动一致性矩阵和运动感知轨迹延续模块，显著提高了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中的视角变化和复杂的无人机-地面相对运动动力学导致跟踪不稳定，现有的方法忽视了外观和运动线索的时空交互，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出AMOT方法，通过外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）计算双向空间一致性，并使用运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC）通过外观引导的预测来激活未匹配的轨迹。

Result: 在VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV三个无人机基准测试中，AMOT性能优于现有方法，且无需训练即可即插即用。

Conclusion: AMOT通过联合利用外观和运动线索，显著提高了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能，具有较强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多光谱/高光谱数据的优势，探索现有RSFMs能否无需大量光谱预训练即可适应不同光谱模态。

Method: 提出两阶段训练：第一阶段使用掩膜重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间与光谱维度属性；第二阶段通过Attribute-refined Adapter迭代查询低层语义特征，实现任务导向的模型调整。

Result: SpectralX能够解释新区域或季节的光谱图像，代码已开源。

Conclusion: SpectralX有效解决了RSFMs在多光谱/高光谱数据上的适应性挑战，显著提高了泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理3D高斯基元的语义特征时存在噪声分割和高斯基元选择混乱的问题，亟需一种更高效的方式来组织语义特征。

Method: 通过引入锚点图结构，将语义特征与高斯基元关联，并利用图传播机制实现紧凑且实例感知的高斯分布。

Result: 在四种应用场景（交互式点击查询、开放词汇文本查询、对象移除编辑和物理模拟）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian框架显著提升了语义分割的准确性，并展现出在多种应用中的潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微调开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）时可能继承的漏洞，揭示其易受转移性攻击的风险。

Method: 提出Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA)，结合Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS)和Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG)，模拟参数变化并优化输出，提升攻击转移性。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL模型家族上，SEA攻击成功率达86.5%，毒性率达49.5%，表明微调后的模型仍易受基础模型漏洞影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了保护微调专有VLM的必要性，需开发全生命周期防御措施以应对继承漏洞。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过显式认知推理和多模态特征融合，实现了更高效的长期动作预测，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新型框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程，并在信息子空间中进行匹配，解决了当前差分隐私数据集蒸馏方法中噪声过多和信息利用率低的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现代机器学习模型依赖包含敏感信息的大数据集，隐私问题日益突出。差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私，但需要大量数据才能达到与原始数据相当的性能。数据集蒸馏（DD）虽高效，但现有方法因同步采样-优化和依赖噪声信号导致信息利用率低。

Method: 引入新型框架，将采样与优化过程解耦，通过在信息子空间中进行匹配来减少差分隐私噪声的影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，新方法仅用每类50张图像即可提升10.0%的性能，且用五分之一的数据集大小即可提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了隐私保护数据蒸馏的效率，为隐私保护机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Motivation: 奶牛的活动和行为与健康及福利相关，传统手动监测效率低且不准确，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用多摄像头系统和计算机视觉技术（如YOLO11-m模型、SAMURAI算法和卡尔曼滤波）实现实时追踪。

Result: 系统性能优越，MOTA达98.7%和99.3%，IDF1分数高于99%，身份切换几乎为零。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时、准确地追踪奶牛活动，有望提升疾病早期预测和农场管理效率。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Result: 实验评估了不同视觉提示形式、地图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN为非专家用户提供了更友好且空间明确的导航方式，有效减少了解释性模糊。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM基准测试中，预测任务提升5.1%，端到端任务提升15%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion框架显著提升自动驾驶任务的性能，且地图扩散模块可扩展至其他方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map

*Xiaotong Zhang,Alexander Broersen,Gonnie CM van Erp,Silvia L. Pintea,Jouke Dijkstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于点的Couinaud分割方法，不依赖先验肝脏血管结构，通过图推理模块学习肝脏血管解剖结构，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术前肝手术规划依赖Couinaud分割以减少出血风险，但现有的点表示方法需要时间获取先验血管结构。

Method: 在点特征上添加图推理模块，通过学习点邻域的亲和力隐式获取解剖信息。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离优于四种现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式提供血管结构即可实现高效分割，为手术规划提供便利。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续手语识别中因缺乏时间边界和多用户差异导致的技术挑战，提升系统的跨用户泛化能力。

Method: 采用系统性特征工程、DBSCAN异常值过滤、空间标准化预处理，并设计了一种基于Conformer的CSLRConformer架构。

Result: 在开发和测试集上分别取得WER 5.60%和12.01%的结果，比赛排名第三。

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适应的有效性，展示了Conformer模型在手语识别中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Motivation: 解决视频中手部运动估计的准确性和时间一致性问题，特别是在手-物体交互时。

Method: 利用扩散模型结合物理知识（如运动状态和约束）来细化初始运动估计，仅使用动作捕捉数据训练。

Result: 显著提升了帧间重建方法的性能，在现有基准测试中达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过扩散和物理知识的结合，有效地提高了手部运动恢复的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 解决事件网络中任务特定设计的问题，以及时空不均匀性带来的挑战。

Method: 采用解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空特征，利用空间填充曲线提升效率，并通过注意力融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集上，性能提升高达68.2%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniEvent通过统一框架实现了高性能，无需任务特定设计，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有研究在视觉搜索任务中对目标和非目标注视点分类的局限性，尤其是缺乏真实场景和自由搜索的情况。

Method: 研究方法包括基于眼动和脑电图特征的分类方法，并通过36名参与者的实验，在140种真实搜索场景中进行验证。

Conclusion: 研究结论是该方法在真实场景中能有效区分目标与非目标注视点，为辅助系统提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Result: 在跨数据集和数据集内基准测试中，DiffusionFF不仅表现出优越的检测性能，还能提供精细的伪造定位。

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在提高检测准确性和精确定位伪造痕迹方面表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Result: 在流媒体和长视频理解任务上，StreamAgent的响应准确性和实时效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent为实际流媒体场景提供了实用的解决方案，展示了其在实时视频理解中的优势。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 医学影像研究中大规模数据共享对促进可重复性和AI模型训练至关重要，但确保患者隐私仍是一个挑战。现有的去标识化工具缺乏有效性评估和标准化。

Method: 开发了一个包含合成PHI/PII的DICOM数据集（MIDI）及评估框架，模拟真实世界身份泄露场景；支持HIPAA隐私规则和DICOM标准评估去标识化工作流程。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

Motivation: 解决全天智能眼镜在连续多模态AI代理集成中的能源效率问题。

Result: 平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能源，同时在记忆任务中性能相当。

Conclusion: 上下文感知触发策略为实现高效节能的全天智能眼镜提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Motivation: 工业检测中，管理多个任务专用模型复杂且低效，统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）有望简化流程。

Method: 使用基于Florence-2的VLM（InspectVLM），并在新的多模态、多任务数据集（InspectMM）上进行训练。

Result: InspectVLM在图像分类和关键点任务上表现良好，但在核心检测指标上不如传统ResNet模型，且对提示变化敏感。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉基础和鲁棒性上不足，不适合用于对精度要求高的工业检测任务。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Method: DBOM利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）的预训练编码器，通过可学习的视觉提示库和提示前缀调整，将输入图像的潜在表示分解为独立的触发器和对象组件。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB数据集上的实验表明，DBOM能够在下游训练前有效检测被污染图像。

Conclusion: DBOM显著提升了DNN训练管道的安全性，并能够泛化到未见过的触发-对象配置。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了对比自监督学习（SSL）在减少一阶段目标检测器对大规模标记数据依赖中的作用，通过在YOLOv5/YOLOv8骨干网络上应用SimCLR框架进行预训练，显著提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 减少一阶段目标检测器（如YOLO系列）对标记数据的依赖，利用未标记数据进行自监督预训练。

Method: 采用SimCLR框架预训练YOLO的卷积骨干网络，结合全局池化和投影头，并在未标记的COCO数据集上进行对比损失优化。

Result: 自监督预训练显著提高了mAP、收敛速度和精度-召回性能，尤其是在低标记数据情况下。YOLOv8预训练后达到0.7663 mAP@50:95。

Conclusion: 对比自监督学习为一阶段检测器提供了高效利用未标记数据的基准，展示了其在标签高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Motivation: 现有NLOS成像方法因忽略隐藏物体的二维特性，导致计算和内存成本过高，限制实际应用。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，采用准菲涅尔变换建立测量数据与场景的直接反演公式，减少计算复杂度。

Result: 新算法运行时间和内存需求降低多个数量级，同时保持成像质量，适用于轻量设备。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动实时高分辨率NLOS成像的广泛应用。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

*Kyungmin Jo,Jooyeol Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自注意力修改方法——分层注意力（Stratified Attention），以解决现有方法在利用图像提示生成图像时的两个问题：分类器自由引导中的信号冲突和对齐与真实感之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大规模文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量、多样化的图像时，难以通过文本提示捕捉复杂细节（如纹理），导致用户意图无法充分体现。尽管已有方法通过修改自注意力机制来引入图像提示，但仍存在分类器自由引导中的信号冲突和对齐与真实感之间的权衡问题。

Method: 本文提出了冲突自由引导（conflict-free guidance），仅将图像提示作为期望条件，避免信号冲突。此外，还提出了分层注意力（Stratified Attention），联合利用图像提示和生成图像的键值，以平衡对齐和真实感。

Result: 通过在三个图像生成任务上的广泛实验，证明所提方法在忠实反映图像提示方面优于现有图像提示模型。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效地解决了现有技术在生成图像时对图像提示的忠实反映问题，并通过分层注意力实现了对齐与真实感的平衡。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Bench2ADVLM的闭环评估框架，用于实时交互式评估自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型（ADVLMs），填补了现有开环评估的不足，并通过实验验证了现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ADVLMs评估主要基于开环设置和静态输入，缺乏对交互行为和真实安全性的闭环评估，因此需要一种更真实的评估方法。

Method: 设计了一个双系统适应架构，将ADVLMs生成的驾驶命令通过通用VLM转化为标准化控制动作；同时通过物理控制抽象层将仿真动作映射到实际车辆，实现闭环测试。

Result: 实验表明，现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下表现有限，验证了框架的诊断能力。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLMs提供了一个统一的闭环评估框架，揭示了现有模型的不足，并支持更全面的安全关键场景生成。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

TL;DR: Protego是一种保护人脸图像隐私的方法，通过动态3D面具防止面部识别技术滥用，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别技术的滥用引发隐私问题，需一种用户中心的保护方法。

Method: Protego将3D面部特征转化为2D表示，并动态生成自然3D面具，干扰面部识别模型。

Result: 实验表明，Protego显著降低检索准确率，效果为现有方法的2倍以上。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

Conclusion: 该研究首次提出条件扩散模型框架用于放疗剂量预测，为自动化治疗计划提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

TL;DR: 提出了分层级联框架（HCF），用于分布式多阶段图像压缩，通过潜在空间转换和策略驱动量化控制，提升性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中现有方法的不足，如渐进式方法的资源利用不足、连续压缩的效率低和质量损失，以及固定参数模型的灵活性不足。

Method: 开发了HCF框架，结合策略驱动量化控制和边缘量化原则，优化率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升最高达0.6dB，计算资源节省显著（如97.8% FLOPs）。

Conclusion: HCF在性能、效率和灵活性上优于其他方法，适用于多阶段压缩场景。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，StarPose 优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose 通过整合历史信息和时空引导，显著提升了单目 3D 姿态估计的性能，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

real-time vision applications through unified, end-to-end detection frameworks.
From YOLOv1's pioneering regression-based detection to the latest YOLOv9, each
version has systematically enhanced the balance between speed, accuracy, and
deployment efficiency through continuous architectural and algorithmic
advancements.. Beyond core object detection, modern YOLO architectures have
expanded to support tasks such as instance segmentation, pose estimation,
object tracking, and domain-specific applications including medical imaging and
industrial automation. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the YOLO
family, highlighting architectural innovations, performance benchmarks,
extended capabilities, and real-world use cases. We critically analyze the
evolution of YOLO models and discuss emerging research directions that extend
their impact across diverse computer vision domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化放射学报告生成方法，结合数据集构建、模型训练和新评估框架，以提升报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，结构化报告能更清晰地提取关键临床信息。

Method: 构建MIMIC-STRUC数据集，训练LLM模型生成标准化报告，并提出S-Score评估指标。

Result: 新方法生成的结构化报告更精确，S-Score能更贴合临床需求。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制化评估指标为放射学报告生成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VLM4D基准，首次专门评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的时空推理能力，揭示了现有模型在动态交互理解上的缺陷，并探索了提升模型性能的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在动态时空交互理解上存在明显不足，缺乏对物体运动、旋转和视角变化等能力的建模，而人类却能轻松完成这些任务。

Method: 作者设计了VLM4D基准，包含多样化的真实和合成视频及配套问答对，重点评估平移和旋转运动、视角感知和运动连续性。同时探索了4D特征场重建和定向时空监督微调等方法。

Result: 评估发现，现有VLMs在整合多种视觉线索和保持时间一致性方面表现不佳，与人类基准存在显著差距。提出的改进方法在提升时空理解上显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步探索提升VLMs时空基础能力的方法，以推动动态环境中更可靠和强大的视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态人机交互中难以同时满足实时性、物理可行性和安全性要求，需提出新解决方案。

Method: 采用自回归反应扩散规划器实时预测动作与反应，并结合强化学习的运动跟踪策略以实现物理真实感。

Result: 在Inter-X和InterHuman数据集上显著提升了运动质量、交互连续性和物理合理性。

Conclusion: Human-X框架在VR/AR和人机协作中展示了应用潜力，提升了交互体验。

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，通过语义驱动的低秩适配器（LoRA）检索和动态聚合，解决了分布式开源LoRA模块在实际部署中的三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大规模模型（如FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3）的照片级真实图像生成取得了进展，但这些架构的实际部署仍受限于参数微调的复杂性。现有的LoRA模块在模型定制中表现良好，但面临稀疏元数据注释、零样本适配需求和多LoRA融合策略不足等问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种包含两个关键组件的框架：（1）基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示之间的共享语义空间；（2）细粒度门控融合机制，计算特定上下文的融合权重以优化多LoRA模块的集成。

Result: 该方法显著提升了图像生成性能，实现了基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 本文在社区开发的LoRA模块与实际部署需求之间建立了关键桥梁，通过标准化适配器集成实现了协作式模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DeflareMamba的新方法，利用状态空间模型高效消除镜头光晕，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除是一个复杂的信息混淆问题，现有方法难以保持上下文一致性。

Method: 设计了分层框架，通过不同步幅采样模式建立长距离像素关联，并采用局部增强的状态空间模型保留细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除多种光晕伪影，同时保持非光晕区域的自然外观。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型应用于光晕去除任务，并在下游应用中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态物体检测框架NRE-Net，通过融合RGB图像、事件流和预测的法线图来提高恶劣光照条件下物体检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下的物体检测是自动驾驶等实际应用的关键，但现有方法（如RGB或事件数据）单独使用时效果不佳，且反射干扰会导致误检。

Method: 设计了NRE-Net，融合RGB图像、事件流和预测的法线图，并提出了适应双流融合模块（ADFM）和事件感知融合模块（EAFM）来优化多模态融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net显著优于现有方法，mAP50提高7.9%和6.1%。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合有效抑制了恶劣光照下的误检，提高了物体检测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于神经辐射场或高斯点云的动态场景建模方法依赖于预标定的物体轨迹或对快速移动物体的欠采样捕获建模困难，导致时间不连续性处理不佳。

Method: 提出了一种联合时间戳优化策略和不确定性蒸馏方法，利用视频扩散模型提取时间一致的先验信息。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合视频扩散模型的先验知识，有效改善了动态场景建模的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于感知的神经质量度量方法，直接在BRDF空间中评估BRDF模型的质量，避免渲染步骤，且比现有指标更符合人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间指标无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更符合人类感知的评估方法。

Method: 设计一个紧凑的多层感知器（MLP），训练数据集包括实测BRDF和合成数据，并使用感知验证的图像空间指标标记。输入参考和近似BRDF样本对，预测JOD分数。

Result: 神经度量与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间指标，但作为BRDF拟合的损失函数表现有限。

Conclusion: 该神经度量为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

Motivation: 解决现有Video-MLLMs因上下文长度限制在长视频场景中性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出Free-MoRef，通过重构视觉标记为多参考块，并引入MoRef-attention和参考融合步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现2倍到8倍长帧输入的全面感知，性能超越专用长视频模型。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef以低成本实现长视频高效理解，性能优越。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中一种可扩展且适应性强的环境信息源，AID4AD数据集的发布促进了这一方向的研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Conclusion: 该框架在真实场景中表现出色，并通过实验进一步探讨了影响步态识别的因素。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Result: 在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到非参考分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强真实推理能力，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

Result: AttriCtrl实现了对单个属性的精确控制和多属性灵活组合，且兼容现有生成框架。

Conclusion: 该框架以低训练开销实现了直观、可定制的美学操控，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

TL;DR: 论文针对电商场景下基于扩散模型的图像生成任务提出DreamEcom-400K数据集和DreamPainter框架，解决了产品与背景一致性和图像控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商背景下，现有方法难以处理产品与背景的空间、阴影和反射一致性，且单纯依赖文本提示控制图像的局限性明显。

Method: 提出了高质量电商数据集DreamEcom-400K和支持文本与参考图像双重控制的框架DreamPainter。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持产品一致性和整合多模态控制信号方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DreamPainter通过结合文本和视觉信息，为电商背景生成提供了更高效和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖RGB-D输入或使用两阶段方法，限制了灵活性和效率。作者希望通过统一框架解决这一问题，仅使用RGB图像实现检测和姿态估计。

Method: 采用神经网格模型结合学习特征和多模型RANSAC，构建了一个统一的检测和姿态估计框架。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，RGB类别级姿态估计的性能平均提升了22.9%，且模型表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的统一方法在性能和鲁棒性上优于传统方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在平衡主体和风格时表现不佳，且通常需要额外训练。K-LoRA虽然无需训练，但涉及多个超参数，适用性受限。

Method: EST-LoRA提出了一种自适应LoRA融合方法，基于矩阵能量、风格差异得分和时间步长，类似MoE架构在每层注意力中动态选择LoRA。

Result: 实验表明，EST-LoRA在质量和效率上均优于现有方法，生成速度更快。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA无需训练，通过自适应机制实现了主体和风格的平衡，为生成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂光照和多光源问题时过于简化，导致图像恢复时出现不一致性等问题，本文旨在改进这一情况。

Method: 提出了一种基于Retinex模型的新型学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度组件指导，实现光照和反射率的精确分离。

Result: 实验表明该方法在非均匀彩色光照和材料反射变化下表现出色，计算成本低。

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和学习框架为解决复杂光照下的图像恢复问题提供了新思路，实验效果显著。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Conclusion: 该算法灵活可定制，适用于日常使用和研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频的传播导致信任危机和社会不稳定，现有的方法在弱监督多模态细粒度时序伪造定位（WS-MTFL）方面缺乏系统性研究。

Method: WMMT通过多任务学习框架整合视觉和音频模态检测任务，采用专家混合结构自适应选择特征和定位头，并提出特征增强模块和时序偏差感知损失来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，WMMT在多项评估指标上与全监督方法效果相当，验证了多任务学习在WS-MTFL中的有效性。

Conclusion: WMMT为弱监督环境下多模态Deepfake检测与时序定位提供了高效解决方案，具有灵活性和高精度。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种零阶自适应框架（ZOA），用于提升量化模型在动态环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，仅需两次前向传播且无需梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，而现有的测试时自适应（TTA）方法因依赖梯度计算而不适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，通过零阶优化实现高效自适应，同时引入域知识管理方案以减少不同域知识的干扰。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，ZOA在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上比现有方法（FOA）提升了5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA为量化模型提供了一种高效且实用的自适应解决方案，显著提升了其动态环境下的性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对抗训练方法RPAT，通过优化模型的感知一致性来缓解清洁精度与对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练（AT）在硬对抗样本上学习不足或过度学习，导致决策边界复杂化，进而引发清洁精度与对抗鲁棒性的权衡问题。本文首次揭示过度学习硬对抗样本是问题的根源。

Method: 定义了新的对抗训练目标“鲁棒感知”（Robust Perception），并提出了RPAT方法，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet）和模型（ResNet-18、PreActResNet-18、WideResNet-34-10）上验证，RPAT优于4种基准方法和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性有效缓解了清洁精度与对抗鲁棒性的权衡问题，为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba模型固定且内容无关，无法动态利用内容依赖。

Method: CAM采用内容感知令牌重组和全局先验集成，优化了状态空间模型。

Result: CMIC模型在Kodak、Tecnick和CLIC基准测试中分别超越VTM-21.0达-15.91%、-21.34%和-17.58% BD-rate。

Conclusion: CAM显著提升了图像压缩性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床WSI分析中持续学习的强大解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和抗运动模糊等优势，但如何高效利用异步事件流实现车载应用是关键挑战。ESI方法旨在解决这一问题，保留事件相机的固有优势。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法重建强度图像，实现实时高帧率（100 FPS）重建，计算负载低，适合车载实现。

Result: 实验表明ESI在运行效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，显著提升了无人机在低光（2-10lux）下的视觉跟踪能力。

Conclusion: ESI是一种高效、实时的强度重建方法，为事件相机在车载视觉任务中的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缓存细粒度特征和固定调度导致内存与计算开销大，且预测失败时输出质量下降。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，减少缓存特征数；提出动态缓存机制，根据首块预测误差决定是否信任泰勒预测。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现3.17x、2.36x和4.14x加速，质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 新方法在速度与质量间取得更好平衡，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Conclusion: I2CR框架通过文本优先和多轮视觉特征提取，显著提升了多模态实体链接任务的性能，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Patho-AgenticRAG的多模态RAG框架，通过结合文本和图像搜索，解决医学病理学领域的高分辨率图像和复杂语义带来的幻觉问题，提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学病理学中，视觉语言模型（VLMs）因超高分辨率、复杂组织结构和临床语义的细微差异，容易产生与视觉证据不符的输出（幻觉），影响临床信任。现有RAG方法主要依赖文本知识库，难以利用视觉诊断线索。

Method: 开发Patho-AgenticRAG框架，基于权威病理学教科书构建的页面级嵌入数据库，支持联合文本-图像搜索，避免图像信息丢失。同时支持推理、任务分解和多轮搜索交互。

Result: 实验表明，Patho-AgenticRAG在多项复杂病理学任务（如多项选择诊断和视觉问答）中显著优于现有多模态模型。

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学领域的幻觉问题，提升了诊断任务的准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the
Patho-AgenticRAG repository:

TL;DR: SplatSSC框架通过深度引导的初始化和解耦高斯聚合器，改进了3D语义场景补全任务，提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于高斯基元的随机初始化效率低和异常基元引入噪声的问题。

Method: 采用深度分支（GMF模块）生成稀疏但有代表性的高斯基元，并使用DGA在几何和语义预测中解耦以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上表现最佳，IoU和mIoU分别提升6.3%和4.1%，延迟和内存占用降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SplatSSC在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，为3D语义场景补全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督双阈值对比学习策略Hermes，用于超声图像分类和分割，通过伪标签和任务间一致性学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中伪标签选择过于自信但错误的问题，并探索分割与分类任务之间的关联性。

Method: 结合对比学习和半监督学习，引入任务间注意力与显著性模块及一致性学习策略。

Result: 在两个公共和一个私有超声数据集上，Hermes显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过任务间协作和一致性学习，有效提升了半监督对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有A2PM方法依赖像素级比较和复杂图匹配，限制了可扩展性和效率，需要改进。

Method: SGAD结合分类和排序子任务的监督策略，并使用HCRF消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD将运行时间减少60倍（0.82s vs. 60.23s），并在多个任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SGAD为区域匹配提供了高效、精确的新方法，设定了新的技术标准。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量计算资源和数据，现有研究未系统评估图像预处理（尤其是边缘增强）对不同模态分割性能的影响。

Method: 使用边缘增强（如kirsch核）预训练基础模型，并开发元学习策略，根据图像标准差和熵选择预训练方式。

Conclusion: 选择性应用边缘增强预训练可优化分割性能，元学习策略为此提供了有效指导。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅依赖事件相机的立体3D物体检测框架，解决了传统传感器在高动态场景中的同步问题，并通过双滤波机制和边界框对齐优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高动态场景下因固定帧率导致感知间隙，事件相机因其异步性和高时间分辨率提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种仅使用事件相机的立体3D物体检测框架，引入双滤波机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过边界框对齐增强回归效果。

Result: 实验表明该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，展示了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过仅使用事件相机的新框架，成功解决了高动态场景下的3D物体检测问题，为自主系统提供了更鲁棒的感知能力。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为‘Confident Meta-learning (CoMet)’的训练策略，用于深度异常检测模型，使其能够从未经筛选的数据集中学习，消除对显式过滤的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督异常检测方法实际上是半监督的，因为它们假设训练数据都是正常的。这种假设简化了训练但需要手动数据筛选，引入了偏见并限制了适应性。

Method: CoMet结合了‘Soft Confident Learning’（对低置信度样本赋予较低权重）和元学习（通过基于验证损失协方差的正则化更新稳定训练）。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、VIADUCT和KSDD2数据集上验证，CoMet显著优于基线方法，且对训练集中的异常不敏感，在所有数据集上达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: CoMet提供了一种无需数据筛选的异常检测训练方法，提高了模型的鲁棒性和适应性，适用于任何可梯度下降训练的模型。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Method: 采用全身自监督表示学习方法，结合竞争风险建模，对多种疾病进行风险评估。

Result: 该方法在心血管疾病、2型糖尿病、慢性阻塞性肺病和慢性肾病等疾病中表现出色，结合心脏MRI后进一步提高了心血管亚组的预测准确性。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Result: 研究表明，不确定性量化方法在AI延迟决策中表现出更强的鲁棒性，尤其是在分布外数据情况下。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法为AI延迟决策提供了更可靠的解决方案，尤其是在面对数据偏移时。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中非视距（NLoS）区域内行人定位的难题，雷达点云数据受多路径反射影响，而摄像头缺乏深度感知能力。

Result: 在真实车辆上搭载的雷达-摄像头系统进行了实验验证，数据集表明该方法适用于室外NLoS驾驶环境。

Conclusion: 提出方法有效解决了NLoS区域内行人定位问题，实验证明了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

TL;DR: 论文提出Text2Lip框架，通过文本输入生成视觉准确的嘴唇运动，克服音频驱动方法的局限，支持无音频情景下的高保真视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动方法依赖高质量音视频配对数据，且声学与唇动映射存在模糊性，限制其扩展性和鲁棒性。Text2Lip旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出基于语音单元的视觉-语音桥梁，逐步替换真实音频为伪音频，通过地标引导渲染器生成逼真面部视频。

Result: Text2Lip在语义保真度、视觉真实性和模态鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控、灵活的面部视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

TL;DR: OTIP是一种基于最优传输理论的方法，用于在整流流模型中实现高质量图像反演，平衡重建准确性和编辑灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像反演在整流流模型中的重要性及其在图像编辑应用中的挑战。

Method: 利用最优传输理论指导反演过程，通过轨迹优化平衡重建和编辑控制。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，重建和编辑指标均有提升。

Conclusion: OTIP在图像反演和编辑任务中表现出色，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于在多样化港口环境中识别运输单元（TUs），并解决了缺乏公开基准数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升港口物流效率需要识别运输单元，但现有研究缺乏公开数据集以覆盖真实港口环境的多样性和动态性。

Method: 提出了TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道，包括三个步骤：分割TUs、检测ID文本位置、识别并验证ID。

Result: TITUS能在多种光照、天气条件和相机视角下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: 通过公开TRUDI数据集，为港口数字化转型提供了基准，提升了物流链效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集为多模态遥感研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Motivation: 推动无监督对象定位领域的发展，减少对聚类方法和后处理的依赖。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: COLER是一种简单有效的无监督模型，有望推动无监督对象定位领域的进步。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶片湿润持续时间（LWD）对植物病害发展至关重要，但现有检测方法缺乏标准化且适应性不足，Hydra旨在填补这一技术空白。

Method: Hydra采用毫米波雷达与摄像头融合技术，通过CNN和Transformer编码器生成特征图，并利用分类器进行检测，数据集增强提升了模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，Hydra在不同场景下对叶片湿润的分类准确率达96%，即使在雨天或弱光环境中也能保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra通过多模态传感器融合与深度学习，显著提升了LWD检测的精度与鲁棒性，适用于实际农业环境。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Conclusion: HGTS-Former为复杂时间序列分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

*Haohan Zheng,Zhenguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs存在严重的幻觉问题，研究发现其根源是模态偏差，即模型难以同时关注视觉和文本模态。提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整模态注意力权重和对比解码策略来缓解幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在理解和推理方面表现出色，但仍存在严重的对象幻觉问题。以往研究认为问题源于视觉编码器和大语言模型（LLMs）的规模不匹配。然而，本文通过深入研究发现，LVLMs在幻觉时可能同时忽略视觉和文本模态，表现为模态偏差，导致对用户指令的分散理解。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过干预和调整视觉与文本令牌的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，从而更好地对齐用户意图。此外，采用对比解码策略减少模型对参数化知识的过度依赖，进一步优化注意力调整的效果。

Result: 实验表明，模态偏差在LVLMs中普遍存在。所提方法有效缓解了多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中的幻觉问题，验证了其泛化性和有效性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LVLMs中模态偏差的现象，并提出了一种简单有效的解决方案，为解决对象幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性脑瘤，生存期预测对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。传统方法依赖肿瘤分割，繁琐且计算量大。

Method: 使用ViTs直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免分割步骤。模型在BRATS数据集上训练和评估。

Result: 测试集准确率为62.5%，在精度、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他模型。但ViTs的泛化能力受限于数据集大小。

Conclusion: ViTs适用于低分辨率医学影像任务，为高效且无需分割的生存期预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet 通过改进序列建模和数据增强技术，显著提升了视觉语音识别的准确性。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

TL;DR: SAMPO通过偏好优化改进基础模型，使其能从稀疏视觉输入推断用户意图，显著提升密集对象的语义分割性能，尤其在医学图像中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基础模型（如SAM）只能分割显式提示的对象，无法泛化到用户隐式需求的语义相关实例，尤其在密集对象场景下效果有限。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化而非像素级微调，使模型能隐式捕捉目标类特征，无需依赖语言模型。

Result: 在医学分割任务中，SAMPO仅用10%训练数据即超越全数据集上的基线方法，PanNuke-T2任务性能提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型建立了意图对齐新范式，无需额外提示生成器或语言模型辅助。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类图像异常检测中，单模型在多类设置下性能较差，且类信息的使用方式对检测阈值影响显著，但此前研究较少关注这一问题。

Method: 提出了HierCore框架，通过分层记忆库估计类特定决策标准，即使无类标签也能有效工作。

Result: 实验表明HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足需求，并保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类图像异常检测中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision

robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and

Conclusion: FMS网络通过多层次的监督机制，有效地提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为多镜头fMRI重建建立了新范式，通过信号分解和语义提示实现了复杂视觉叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在3D重建中高效但有浮动伪影问题。本文提出EFA-GS方法，从频域角度优化高斯分布，显著减少伪影，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在低质量初始化时产生浮动伪影，影响视觉质量。研究从频域角度分析伪影成因，发现未优化的高斯分布是主因。

Method: 提出EFA-GS方法，选择性扩展未优化的高斯分布，优先学习低频信息，并结合深度和尺度策略动态优化。

Result: 实验显示EFA-GS大幅减少伪影，保持高频细节，在RWLQ数据集上PSNR提升1.68 dB，并在3D编辑任务中验证有效性。

Conclusion: EFA-GS通过频域分析和动态优化，成功减少3DGS的浮动伪影，提升重建质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

TL;DR: ReMake提出了一种结合实例分割和单目深度估计的新型深度补全框架，旨在解决透明物体导致深度数据不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的光学特性导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，降低了机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 通过实例分割掩码区分透明区域，结合单目深度估计提供上下文信息，提升深度补全的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ReMake在基准数据集和现实场景中均优于现有方法，表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域和利用单目深度估计，显著提升了深度补全的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

Motivation: 由于短视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）快速增长，准确预测视频互动对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要。但现有方法难以有效建模跨特征和多模态的交互。

Method: 采用两种代表性的LMMs（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL），分别整合音频、视觉、语言特征或仅视觉和语言特征。在SnapUGC数据集上训练，并通过模型集成进一步提升性能。

Result: 两种模型均表现出色，其中VideoLLaMA2因整合音频特征表现更优，模型集成后在ICCV竞赛中获得第一名。

Conclusion: LMMs在视频互动预测中具有显著效果，尤其是整合多模态特征（如音频）可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 评估艺术斑马线的视觉复杂度对行人检测模型的干扰，揭示潜在的监控系统漏洞。

Method: 通过合成艺术图案与固定监控场景，分别在正常和恶意条件下测试模型的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，恶意设计的图案可隐藏真实行人或制造虚假检测。

Conclusion: 城市视觉监控系统需考虑环境视觉变化，以设计更鲁棒的行人感知模型。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架通过动态调整视频压缩级别，结合天气和光照条件，提升了智能交通系统中的车辆检测准确性并显著降低了带宽需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中的实时视频传输常受带宽限制，压缩技术虽可减少带宽需求但会降低视频质量，进而影响车辆检测精度。环境因素（如天气和光照）进一步加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 采用Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC)框架，动态调整视频压缩级别以适应天气和光照变化，确保车辆检测准确性的同时优化带宽使用。

Result: 在中等带宽条件下，PAVC将车辆检测准确性提升13%，带宽需求降低8.23倍；在极低带宽区域，带宽需求减少72倍且保持检测性能。

Conclusion: PAVC通过环境感知的动态压缩技术，有效平衡了智能交通系统中视频质量与带宽需求，提升了系统实时性和可靠性。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全景RGB-D传感器成本高或难以获取的问题，通过单目输入实现高效导航。

Method: 提出MonoDream框架，利用UNR联合对齐视觉语义与语言动作意图，并引入LPD任务监督UNR学习。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，缩小了与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream展示了单目输入在导航任务中的潜力，为实际部署提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Motivation: 现有文本到运动生成方法在多样性和物理合理性方面存在局限，需要一种更高效、精确的方法。

Method: 结合双向动量模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-Classier-Free指导，提升运动生成的质量和效率。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准测试中，ReMoMask的FID分数分别比之前的SOTA方法提高了3.88%和10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过创新的跨模态对齐和运动生成机制，显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to

<details>

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA评估中依赖点估计，忽视了性能方差的重要影响，如随机模型输出、训练种子敏感性和超参数配置等。

Method: 通过分析14个广泛使用的VQA基准，研究训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能方差的影响，并探索Cloze-style评估的有效性。

Result: 研究揭示了当前评估实践的局限性，并证明Cloze-style评估能减少随机性，提高可靠性。

Conclusion: 提倡采用方差感知方法来提升MLLMs的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决大时空跨度下复杂刚性运动建模的挑战，现有方法局限于短期小规模变形且物理一致性考虑不足。

Method: 分为目标建模（动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制）和运动恢复（学习每帧SE(3)位姿），引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，并设计卡尔曼融合方案。

Conclusion: PMGS通过多阶段优化和物理约束，有效提升了复杂刚性运动的动态重建能力。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，纯文本数据训练效果优于多模态数据，7B模型达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 释放了所有资源，为医学多模态推理研究提供了开放基础。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Conclusion: AugPT是一种高效的自增强提示调优方法。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督的两阶段框架，用于MRI扫描中脑肿瘤的准确分割，无需真实标签，在BraTS 2021数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤的精确分割对临床诊断和治疗计划至关重要，但现有方法在大规模异质数据集上效果有限。

Method: 采用残差引导的DDPM模型进行跨模态合成，结合轻量级U-Net利用残差和多模态输入提升分割性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高分割精度和扩展性方面表现出色，适用于真实世界的多中心MRI数据集。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mobile U-ViT的轻量级医疗图像分割模型，结合了ConvUtr和大核局部-全局-局部块（LGL），在资源受限的移动设备上实现了高效且高性能的医学图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对自然图像优化的移动模型在医疗任务上表现不佳，因医学图像信息密度高且语义差异大，需设计轻量且高效的医疗专用网络。

Method: 采用ConvUtr作为分层补丁嵌入，结合大核LGL块实现局部-全局信息交换，并使用浅层轻量Transformer瓶颈和级联解码器进行长程建模和密集预测。

Result: 在8个公开2D和3D数据集上取得SOTA性能，包括零样本测试的4个未见数据集，验证了其高效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医疗图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

*Hu Zhangfeng,Shi mengxin*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新型框架，利用模态内和模态间的交互来解决多模态情感分析中的模态不完美问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视模态内和模态间的复杂依赖关系，未能充分利用可用模态捕捉互补语义。

Method: 设计可学习的超图建模模态内时间依赖，使用有向图探索模态间相关性，并结合完美样本知识监督交互过程。

Result: 在MOSI和MOSEI数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过模态内和模态间的交互及监督学习，能更鲁棒地处理不完美的多模态数据。

Abstract: The inevitable modality imperfection in real-world scenarios poses
significant challenges for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). While existing
methods tailor reconstruction or joint representation learning strategies to
restore missing semantics, they often overlook complex dependencies within and
across modalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available
modalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes
a novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality
interactions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from
complementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable
hypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual
information within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore
inter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing
complementary information across different modalities. Finally, the knowledge
from perfect samples is integrated to supervise our interaction processes,
guiding the model toward learning reliable and robust joint representations.
Extensive experiments on MOSI and MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的PCS框架，旨在解决数据科学生命周期中的不确定性问题，并结合生成式AI为实践者提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学作为AI的支柱，其不可复现性问题源于DSLC中的不确定性，传统统计方法难以解决。

Result: 案例研究展示了PCS框架的实际应用及其在减少不确定性中的有效性。

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学提供了更可靠的方法，特别适用于实践者，并能结合生成式AI优化决策。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Result: 在多个PDE实验中，相对均方误差降低达三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该框架为多尺度和时间依赖PDE系统提供了稳健解决方案，弥合深度学习与物理驱动建模之间的差距。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Conclusion: 该协议为实践者提供了可复制的蓝图，并为未来在不同遥感应用中操作化基础模型奠定了基础，展示了框架的可扩展性。

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了数据驱动工具如何提升设计安全性、优化验证流程，并为结构设计中的关键问题（如屈曲）提供决策支持。

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

Motivation: 随着对无缝互联网接入需求的增长，尤其在交通和偏远地区，卫星连接的可靠性至关重要。机器学习可以优化网络切换，提升用户体验。

Method: 分析GEO卫星与飞机通信的真实数据集，利用机器学习预测信号质量。

Result: 预测模型在测试数据上F1得分为0.97，验证了其高准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型可推广至其他移动物体（如车辆、火车），并通过自动化网络切换提升整体通信效率。

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Conclusion: FRA框架及其算法和架构显著提升了图匹配问题的效率和精度，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习方法在拼接检测中表现优异，但对训练条件过于敏感，使其实际部署困难。本文发现模型对未见后处理的反应受权重影响，提出通过最大化潜在边距选择更鲁棒的检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习拼接检测工具对训练条件敏感，后处理会显著降低性能，需提升模型在操作环境中的可靠性。

Method: 训练同一架构的不同模型变体，选择潜在边距最大化的版本。

Result: 潜在边距分布与模型对后处理图像的泛化能力强相关。

Conclusion: 通过优化潜在边距可构建更鲁棒的拼接检测器。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer模型在预训练中如何获取知识以及在微调中如何提取知识的问题，引入了一个包含自注意力和MLP模块的单层Transformer框架，并证明其在特定条件下能有效获取和提取知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对Transformer如何获取和提取知识的理解有限，且多为单层、仅注意力机制的研究。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，并验证MLP模块在知识存储中的关键作用。

Method: 提出一个包含自注意力和MLP模块的单层Transformer框架，通过梯度动态分析其收敛性和泛化能力。实验验证包括合成数据和真实数据集（如PopQA）。

Result: 模型在特定条件下能实现近最优训练损失和低泛化误差，表明有效获取和提取知识；反之则易产生幻觉。实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 本文的理论和实验表明，Transformer的知识获取和提取能力依赖于MLP模块和特定数据条件，为理解模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained
GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with
consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout
training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k
steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of
activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于经典方法和大多数深度学习替代方案，并能无监督表征异常特征。

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD通过多任务框架有效提升了时间序列异常检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

TL;DR: PALACE框架通过预测隐藏的推理token数量，实现了对商用LLM服务的用户端审计，解决了token通胀和潜在超额计费问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用LLM服务隐藏内部的推理过程，但仍对所有生成的token收费，包括隐藏的中间步骤，导致用户担忧token通胀和超额计费，需要可靠的审计方法。

Method: 提出PALACE框架，通过GRPO增强的自适应模块和轻量级领域路由器，从提示-答案对中估计隐藏的推理token数量，无需访问内部数据。

Result: 实验表明，PALACE在数学、编程、医学和通用推理任务中实现了低相对误差和高预测精度，支持细粒度成本审计和通胀检测。

Conclusion: PALACE是标准化预测审计的重要初步步骤，为提高透明性、责任性和用户信任提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习中标签分布不匹配问题，防止深度神经网络因过度自信导致错误。

Method: 提出CaliMatch方法，结合自适应标签平滑和温度缩放，无需手动调参。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 改进校准对安全SSL至关重要，CaliMatch是有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态、自动和系统化的DAS红队测试框架，用于持续检测大型语言模型（LLM）在临床实践中的安全性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态安全基准在快速发展的LLM面前容易过时，无法全面反映模型的可信度。

Method: 使用动态红队测试框架（DAS），通过对抗性代理自主生成测试用例、识别漏洞并实时评估响应。

Result: 应用DAS测试15个LLM后发现，尽管静态基准表现良好（如MedQA准确率超80%），但在动态测试中暴露出高失败率：稳健性94%失败、隐私泄露86%、公平性81%、幻觉率66%。

Conclusion: DAS框架提供了一种可扩展的动态监测方法，为医疗AI的安全部署提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序多模态数据分类任务存在长程依赖和跨模态交互的挑战，现有方法多独立处理模态且忽略时序依赖，导致复杂结构关系表征能力不足。

Method: 提出HHN框架，采用分段后图建模策略，通过超边捕捉模态内结构，基于时序对齐和注意力实现跨模态融合。

Result: 在四个多模态数据集上取得SOTA结果，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: HHN通过创新的建模策略显著提升了时序多模态数据分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Result: 发现O3和NO2污染物与死亡率存在协同关联，尤其是在Bergamo和Brescia省份；城市绿地密度也与污染物在预测死亡率中表现出协同影响。

Conclusion: Hi-Fi作为一种广泛的工具，为XAI和复杂系统中高阶关系的分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

Result: 实验表明 OKG-LLM 优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM 为 SST 预测提供了一种结合领域知识与数据驱动的新方法，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态大语言模型在通用嵌入任务中的高效适配提供了有效途径，显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Conclusion: U^2QT框架支持工业级应用并与语言模型无缝集成。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合迭代主题细化、对比提示和主动学习的分类框架，用于解决零样本文本分类在动态环境中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对零样本文本分类在动态知识领域（如工单系统）中的困难，现有大语言模型（LLMs）由于主题可分性有限而表现不佳，而少样本方法则受限于数据多样性不足。

Method: 提出了一种结合迭代主题细化、对比提示和主动学习的框架，通过人类干预动态调整类别定义，无需重新训练即可集成新类别。

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia数据集上的评估显示，准确率分别为91%和84%，且引入新类别后性能稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架通过基于提示的语义推理，在有限监督下实现了细粒度分类的高效表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的PGNNIV框架，通过降阶建模技术解决高维数据扩展性问题，提升了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PGNNIV模型在高维数据扩展性方面存在挑战，需要改进以提升其应用范围。

Method: 引入基于谱分解、POD和预训练自编码器的替代解码器结构，并结合迁移学习策略。

Result: 改进后的PGNNIV框架成功识别本构状态方程，保持高预测准确性，并提升抗噪能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可以根据不同需求定制，有效解决PGNNIV模型的扩展性挑战。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Motivation: 个体投资者在金融市场中信息处理能力不足，缺乏专业分析，而现有金融知识库更新慢且非结构化，限制了大型语言模型的有效性。

Method: 提出了FinKario数据集和FinKario-RAG检索策略，前者通过事件增强和结构化模板自动整合实时数据，后者优化了金融知识的检索效率。

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识更新和结构化问题，为投资者提供了更高效的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了多模态深度学习在生物医学信号分类中的新视角，指出并非所有模态融合都能提升性能，关键在于特征域的互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在分析多模态融合对生物医学信号分类的影响，验证不同特征域组合的效果，超越传统的启发式特征选择方法。

Method: 设计了五种深度学习模型（三种单模态和两种多模态），并通过自举法和贝叶斯推理评估其性能。

Result: 结果表明，时间和时频域的融合（Hybrid 1）显著优于基线，但加入频域（Hybrid 2）未带来进一步提升，反而可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态设计的关键原则：性能优化依赖于特征域的内在互补性，而非模态数量，提出了可量化互补性的数学框架。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Motivation: 当前NLI模型存在对抗性弱点和鲁棒性不足的问题，VAULT旨在通过自动化方法发现并修复这些弱点。

Method: VAULT采用三阶段流程：1）平衡少量样本检索，结合语义和词法相似性；2）通过LLM生成对抗性假设并验证；3）将验证后的对抗性示例逐步注入训练集。

Result: VAULT显著提升了RoBERTa-base模型的性能，如SNLI提升4.12%，ANLI提升5.91%，MultiNLI提升17.32%，且优于此前方法。

Conclusion: VAULT通过自动化对抗性数据生成和训练，实现了NLI任务的快速鲁棒性提升，无需人工干预。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习在计算病理学中主要依赖H&E染色组织图像，但缺乏对高维多组学数据（如转录组、甲基化组等）的集成，这限制了分子表征和临床理解的深度。

Method: MORPHEUS通过掩码建模目标，随机遮蔽部分组学数据，促使模型学习跨模态的生物学意义关联，支持单独使用病理学或结合任意组学子集。

Result: 在大规模泛癌队列预训练中，MORPHEUS在多种任务和模态组合下表现优于现有方法，并具备任意模态间的组学生成能力。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS为肿瘤学中多模态基础模型的开发提供了高效框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT、Perplexity和Gemini等LLM工具的广泛应用，高效的推理系统需求日益增长。现有系统在处理预填充和解码两阶段计算结构时需要新的路由和调度策略。

Method: 提出理论框架，基于最优分块和动态资源分配原则设计RAD调度器；针对实际需求，设计了SLAI调度器，通过实时测量和请求重排序优化服务级别目标（SLO）。

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上测试，SLAI比Sarathi-Serve降低中位TTFT延迟53%，最大服务容量提升26%，尾部TBT延迟满足约束。

Conclusion: SLAI调度器通过动态资源分配和实时优化，显著提升了LLM推理系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Conclusion: v-PuNNs将数论与深度学习结合，为分层数据提供了高效、精确且可解释的模型。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学数据集缺乏对功能组（FG）信息的细粒度利用，而功能组数据能帮助构建更可解释、结构感知的LLMs，促进分子设计与药物发现。

Method: 开发FGBench数据集，包含625K分子属性推理问题，精确标注功能组及其位置，涵盖单功能组影响、多功能组交互和分子比较三类任务。

Result: 在7K数据上的测试显示，现有LLMs在功能组级别推理上表现不佳，表明需提升相关推理能力。

Conclusion: FGBench为构建功能组级别数据集提供了方法论框架，有望推动LLMs对分子结构-属性关系的细粒度理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

Babai's well-known nearest-plane algorithm. We furthermore provide geometric
intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于流匹配的概率预测方法，用于处理不确定性高维动态系统的多输出问题，并引入生成式机器学习方法进行物理逻辑扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺失变量和噪声数据，传统数学模型在处理动态系统时表现不佳，机器学习的随机方法可以更好地应对这种病态问题。

Method: 提出了一种变种流匹配方法，通过概率分布而非单点预测来估计未来状态，并使用生成式机器学习方法进行扰动。

Result: 方法在高维动态系统（如全球天气模型）上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定性动态系统的概率预测提供了新的数学基础和实践方案。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Motivation: 学生心理健康问题日益严重，传统的主观调查和定期评估方法在及时干预方面效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的数据驱动方法。

Method: 采用六阶段流程，包括预处理、特征选择、降维和六种基分类器训练，并通过四种集成策略（硬投票、软投票、加权投票和堆叠）提升性能。

Result: 最佳模型在两个数据集上分别达到93.09%和99.53%的准确率，超过现有基准。

Conclusion: 该框架展现了数据驱动系统在早期压力检测中的潜力，适用于实际学术环境以支持学生心理健康。

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中的冷启动问题，提升新用户或不活跃用户的体验。

Method: 使用NDCG作为目标函数构建BUS树，结合社交图谱优化公平性，生成行为和社交模式结合推荐。

Result: 离线分析显示BUS优于传统方法，线上测试显著提升产品指标。

Conclusion: 研究首次提出了一种结合多样化用户属性的树状推荐框架，具有实际工业规模应用价值。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Motivation: PRNG是高度非线性的过程，而Transformer擅长处理复杂非线性关系，因此可以利用其生成高质量的伪随机数。

Method: 理论上分析了Transformer模型（尤其是仅解码器结构）模拟LCG和MT PRNG的能力，并通过实验验证生成的随机数的质量。

Result: 实验表明Transformer生成的伪随机数通过了大多数NIST测试，热图显示出明显的统计随机性。

Conclusion: Transformer在PRNG中具有潜力，能够生成高质量的伪随机数，且具备一定的抗预测攻击能力。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在现实场景中的鲁棒性不足，论文旨在解决合并过程中任务向量范数差异和源模型低置信度问题。

Method: 提出DisTaC方法，通过知识蒸馏调整任务向量范数并提升源模型置信度。

Result: 实验表明DisTaC能显著提升合并性能，尤其是对原本无法合并的模型。

Conclusion: DisTaC有效解决了模型合并的关键问题，提升了多任务学习的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

TL;DR: T2S框架通过token化参数和跨注意力机制，同时解决了终身模仿学习中的灾难性遗忘和新技能学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习中需平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能学习，目前方法未能统一解决这两方面问题。

Method: 提出T2S框架，通过token化模型参数并引入跨注意力机制，结合语言引导实现高效知识迁移。

Result: 实验显示T2S有效防止遗忘（NBT 1.0%），新技能学习参数增量最小（8.0%），知识迁移高效（FWT 77.7%）。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多代理强化学习的风险感知框架MARS，通过异构代理集合和元自适应控制器动态调整风险偏好，显著降低回撤和波动性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习模型在动态市场中难以平衡风险和回报，需一种能自适应市场变化的框架。

Method: 提出MARS框架，包括异构代理集合和Meta-Adaptive Controller（MAC），代理具有不同风险偏好，MAC动态调整代理权重。

Result: 在多个国际市场指数上测试，有效降低最大回撤和波动性，同时保持竞争力回报。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性和动态调整机制，在风险与回报间取得了优越平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RSPO的新方法，旨在解决大语言模型训练中风险中性目标与风险寻求评估指标之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的后训练优化目标是风险中性（最大化期望奖励），但评估时却依赖风险寻求的指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能下降，因此需要一种直接优化这些指标的方法。

Method: RSPO通过利用闭式概率（即一个回答在k次采样中为最大值的概率）来直接优化Pass@k和Max@k，解决了低奖励回答因与高奖励回答并存而被误增强的问题。

Result: RSPO提出了高效且无偏的梯度估计器，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: RSPO填补了训练与评估之间的风险偏好差异，解决了优化效率低下的问题。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Motivation: 传统神经网络依赖单调激活函数（如ReLU），需大规模参数化模型以逼近复杂函数，限制了效率。

Method: 设计PLU激活函数，结合排斥性重参数化技术，避免其退化为非表达性线性函数。

Result: 仅含两个PLU神经元的小型MLP即可解决螺旋分类问题，标准激活函数无法达成。

Conclusion: PLU通过周期性非单调性实现指数级参数效率提升，推动神经元从分段逼近向类傅里叶合成的范式转变。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

Motivation: 现实图中的节点特征可能部分缺失，直接使用图神经网络（GNNs）会导致下游任务效果不佳。现有GNN方法在特征缺失情况下表现甚至不如传统结构模型。因此，论文旨在提出一种新框架来优化这一问题。

Method: GOODIE采用混合方法，结合标签传播（LP）和特征传播（FP）分支。首先设计了一个GNN解码器，使LP分支输出的嵌入与FP分支对齐；然后通过新设计的结构-特征注意力机制自动捕捉结构和特征的重要性，并利用伪标签对比学习优化最终预测。

Result: 实验表明，GOODIE在特征缺失或充足情况下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE通过结合标签传播和特征传播，有效解决了特征缺失问题，并在多种情况下表现出色。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FUL中由于非独立同分布数据和去中心化特性导致的全局均匀性不足问题。

Result: 在跨设备和跨场景的联邦学习中，SSD显著提升了表示质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD通过优化全局均匀性，成为FUL中解决表示质量问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在元强化学习中，仅通过最大化贪婪目标（仅利用）也可以自然产生探索行为，前提是满足三个条件：环境结构重复、代理具备记忆能力、以及长期信用分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，提出仅通过贪婪目标也能实现探索行为的假设。

Method: 通过实验验证三个条件对探索行为的影响，包括重复环境结构、代理记忆和长期信用分配。

Result: 在具备重复环境和代理记忆的条件下，贪婪目标政策表现出探索行为；去除条件1或2时探索行为消失，但条件3的去除不总是阻止探索。

Conclusion: 在适当条件下，探索行为可以从统一的奖励最大化过程中自然涌现，而非必须独立设计。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种公平感知的联邦认知诊断框架（FedCD），通过参数解耦策略保护数据隐私，并实现公平诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育平台产生大量学习数据，认知诊断面临隐私和公平性挑战。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架FedCD，通过参数解耦策略分别训练本地个性化参数和全局共享参数。

Result: 实验表明FedCD在三个真实数据集上优于五种联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedCD在保护隐私的同时实现了公平且精确的认知诊断。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

*Joshua Dimasaka,Christian Geiß,Emily So*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图变分状态空间模型（GraphVSSM），用于动态量化区域灾害韧性，结合了图深度学习、状态空间建模和变分推断，弥补了现有物理脆弱性评估方法的不足。通过实际案例和公开数据集验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物理脆弱性评估方法存在静态、成本高、局限性大等问题，无法满足动态灾害风险管理的需求。本文旨在利用时间序列卫星影像和机器学习方法，改进大尺度物理脆弱性的动态建模。

Method: 提出GraphVSSM模型，整合图深度学习、状态空间建模和变分推断，以概率时空推断框架处理空间上下文关系、有限时间观测和不确定性。

Result: 成功应用于菲律宾奎松市、孟加拉国Khurushkul社区和塞拉利昂弗里敦的灾害评估，并发布了METEOR 2.5D地理空间数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了区域灾害韧性评估能力，还为全球灾害风险管理提供了新工具，同时贡献了弱监督下的概率深度学习框架。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的方法，用于从稀疏数据中重建流场，并解决了计算资源受限的问题。通过二维和三维流场案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物理科学和工程应用中，获取大样本数据成本高昂，而传统DNN需要大量数据训练。PINNs通过嵌入物理原理，能够在数据稀疏的情况下解决流场重建问题。

Method: 研究采用PINNs框架，比较了标准PINN和改进版BC-PINN的训练方法，并通过动态调整损失函数权重和放宽物理约束探索性能提升。研究还验证了其在复杂湍流场中的应用。

Result: 结果表明，PINNs方法即使在数据稀疏和计算资源有限的情况下，也能准确重建二维和三维流场，并有效捕捉流动物理特性。

Conclusion: PINNs为工程中流场重建问题提供了新的解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺和资源受限情况下表现优异。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

*Christopher Godwin Udomboso,Caston Sigauke,Ini Adinya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FSV的混合采样验证方法，结合SRS和KFCV优化数据分区，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KFCV虽增强模型稳健性，但计算成本高且数据打乱复杂，SRS可能在非平衡数据中失效，因此需要一种更优的数据分区方法。

Method: 提出FSV模型，整合SRS和KFCV，引入加权因子增强性能和泛化能力，采用多指标评估。

Result: FSV在ME、VE、MSE等指标上优于SRS和KFCV，特别适合资源有限和大数据集场景。

Conclusion: FSV提供了一种高效、可靠的数据分区解决方案，为机器学习实践提供实用工具。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，用于评估深度强化学习算法的优化限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，由于策略需要在动态变化的状态和动作分布下训练，容易导致性能下降甚至崩溃。因此，即使探索算法或奖励目标有所改进，优化困难可能仍会阻碍性能提升。

Method: 通过提出一种新的实用次优性估计器，评估深度强化学习算法的实际优化限制，并在不同环境和RL算法中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，算法生成的最佳经验比学习到的策略性能高2-3倍，说明深度RL方法仅利用了一半的优秀经验。

Conclusion: 深度RL方法在利用生成的经验方面存在明显不足，优化限制是性能提升的主要瓶颈。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中LoRA更新的局部模型在服务器端如何聚合的关键问题，提供理论支持。

Method: 将当前聚合方法分为SP和PS两类，提出ABO操作符并推导一般收敛条件，分析不同方法的收敛速率。

Result: 证明SP和PS方法均满足收敛条件，但收敛速率不同；实验验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 为联邦学习中的LoRA聚合策略提供理论框架，指导实际应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过随机近似方法优化Gibbs测度中相互作用核和限制势的调整，以提高数值积分算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gibbs测度在模拟粒子系统中有广泛应用，但调整其相互作用核和限制势以匹配目标分布π通常需要额外的蒙特卡洛近似。论文旨在解决这一问题，并证明随机近似方法能够保持快速大偏差原理，从而提升积分算法的效率。

Method: 作者利用Garcia--Zelada (2019)提出的大偏差理论，证明了随机近似方法在非奇异相互作用核和Coulomb核情形下的有效性。对于Coulomb核，近似需基于另一个Gibbs测度。

Result: 研究表明，随机近似方法可以保持快速大偏差原理，使得积分算法优于独立或马尔可夫求积法，同时还证明了Coulomb核情形下近似势能的一致收敛性。

Conclusion: 通过随机近似方法优化Gibbs测度的参数调整，论文为高效数值积分算法提供了理论支持，特别是在复杂相互作用核情形下。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

Result: 内存容量随输入空间分离度指数增长，特征相关性略微降低容量，且在高阶能量函数中影响加剧。

Conclusion: 研究为DAM的理论与实践搭建了桥梁，可能启发更多以数据为中心的方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列预测中因统计特性跨域变化而导致准确性、可解释性和物理可信度不足的问题。

Method: 提出CPformer模型，利用自监督的领域无关概念和基于物理定律的可微残差，同时保留长上下文的注意力机制。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上测试，CPformer在多数情况下达到最低误差，相比FEDformer，MSE在Electricity、Traffic和Illness上分别降低23%、44%和61%。

Conclusion: CPformer在保留Transformer优点的同时，通过引入物理约束和概念增强显著提升了预测性能，尤其在非严格周期数据上表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Conclusion: 研究证明流动性代理指标能显著提高预测模型的准确性，为交易者和开发者提供了有价值的策略参考。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Method: 提出UniExtreme模型，包含自适应频率调制（AFM）模块和事件先验增强（EPA）模块，分别处理极端天气的频谱差异和多样性。

Result: 实验表明UniExtreme在极端和一般天气预测中均优于现有方法，展示了更强的适应性。

Conclusion: UniExtreme为极端天气预测提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Result: 在32个基准数据集上表现优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据驱动的方式有效改善了不平衡回归问题。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法使AI合成规划系统更接近高通量筛选的低延迟需求，并改善用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Transformer在分类任务中表现不佳的原因，并提出了一种改进方法——历史标记（history tokens），以提升模型在金融、电商和医疗领域任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现Transformer在预测未来目标的分类任务中表现不如RNN，主要原因在于缺乏一个能紧凑且有效表示整个序列的单一状态向量，且对比预训练无法捕捉局部上下文。

Method: 提出历史标记（history tokens）的概念，通过在下一个标记预测预训练中积累历史信息来改进Transformer模型。

Result: 改进后的Transformer模型在金融、电商和医疗任务中取得了显著提升的效果。

Conclusion: 历史标记的引入有效解决了Transformer在序列建模中的局限性，为相关领域的应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

TL;DR: AutochaosNet是一种无需调参和训练的Neurochaos Learning变体，通过Champernowne常数的混沌序列实现高效分类。


<details>

Motivation: Neurochaos Learning需要调参和复杂计算，AutochaosNet旨在简化流程并提升效率。

Method: 利用Champernowne常数的混沌序列，定义激发时间边界提取特征，提出两种简化变体（TM和TM-FR）。

Result: AutochaosNet分类性能优于或接近原版，训练时间更短，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: AutochaosNet高效且可扩展，未来将探索更多混沌映射以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer训练中学习率调度的冷却阶段（cooldown phase），揭示了其机制对模型性能的影响以及超参数优化的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷却阶段在Transformer训练中对性能至关重要，但其机制尚不清楚，需要深入研究以优化学习率调度。

Method: 通过分析Warmup-Stable-Decay（WSD）学习率调度器的冷却阶段，研究不同冷却形状对模型偏差-方差权衡的影响，并可视化损失景观。

Result: 研究发现，平衡探索和利用的冷却形状表现最佳，且优化AdamW超参数（如提高β₂）也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 冷却阶段的优化与超参数调优同样重要，为Transformer训练中的WSD调度器配置提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

*Jiaxing Qiu,Dongliang Guo,Brynne Sullivan,Teague R. Henry,Tom Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing InstructTime, an instruction-based time series editor that uses natural language for flexible and customizable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editors lack flexibility in condition format and customizable control over editing strength.

Method: InstructTime embeds time series and natural language instructions into a shared multi-modal space, decodes embeddings for edits, and uses multi-resolution encoders for local/global edits.

Result: InstructTime achieves high-quality, controllable edits, generalizes to unseen instructions, and adapts to new conditions via few-shot learning.

Conclusion: InstructTime is a state-of-the-art, flexible, and accessible solution for time series editing.

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

TL;DR: FlashSVD是一个专为SVD压缩的大型语言模型设计的端到端框架，解决了现有方法在推理时的内存开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SVD压缩方法忽略了推理时的激活内存开销，限制了其实际部署的可行性。

Method: 提出了FlashSVD框架，将低秩投影内核直接融合到自注意力和FFN中，避免生成完整激活缓冲区。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD减少了70.2%的峰值激活内存和75%的中间临时内存，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩LLMs在内存受限环境下的部署提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

Motivation: 现有深度预测模型常因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知先验而无法捕捉时序中的周期性结构。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换提取低频成分，初始化正弦嵌入，并采用双速学习计划保持频率结构。

Result: 实验中，方法在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其是在长时预测上，同时能在合成数据中恢复真实频率。

Conclusion: 通过注入频谱先验，该方法增强了深度时序模型的稳健性和可解释性，特别适用于长时预测任务。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Conclusion: 该框架可显著提升设计性能和设计师效率，适用于工程设计生命周期。

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 刚性系统中的参数梯度消失是所有A稳定和L稳定积分方案的固有特性，限制了刚性神经ODE的训练和参数识别能力。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

Conclusion: 提出的概率方法能够高效找到近似最优解，展现出在解决ESPP问题上的潜力。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Conclusion: KAN的自适应能力显著影响预测性能，提供了基于实证的KAN应用指南。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Motivation: 以往工作中启发式权重函数缺乏理论依据，本文旨在通过分析异方差性，提出更优的权重函数推导方法。

Method: 通过分析异方差性，推导出广义、任意阶去噪分数匹配损失的最优权重函数，尤其关注与扩散模型相关的一阶形式。

Result: 发现启发式权重是一阶泰勒近似，且在参数梯度方差上优于最优权重，有助于更稳定高效的训练。

Conclusion: 启发式权重虽简单，但在实际应用中表现优异，为去噪分数匹配提供理论支持。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Motivation: 针对多数据流学习中的异质性和概念漂移问题，现有方法通常假设数据流同质且采用静态架构，限制了在复杂动态环境中的泛化能力。

Method: CAMEL为每个数据流分配独立系统（专属特征提取器和任务头部），动态专家池捕捉流特定模式，辅助专家通过注意力机制实现知识整合，AET策略动态管理专家生命周期以应对概念漂移。

Result: 实验表明CAMEL在多数据流中具有优异泛化能力，并能有效应对复杂概念漂移。

Conclusion: CAMEL通过动态协作和自适应专家管理，为多数据流学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Method: 基于GRPO框架的EPRLI算法，针对数学问题引入难度感知干预，应用于1.5B参数的LLM。

Result: 在AIME24（50.0%）、Math500（89.2%）、AMC（77.1%）、Minerva（35.3%）和OBench（51.9%）等基准测试中表现优秀，超越O1-Preview，与O1-mini相当。

Conclusion: EPRLI算法在开放源代码框架下实现了与先进LLM相当的推理能力，为研究社区提供了可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large

draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series,

Motivation: 解决强化学习中因低质量数据或错误行为导致的决策问题，通过外部代理实时评估和反馈，提升模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: ARL框架包含两个外部代理：一个实时评估模型决策并生成拒绝数据管道，另一个选择性地筛选反馈以生成高质量训练数据。

Result: 实验证明，结合人类反馈显著提升模型在复杂环境中的决策能力，适用于实际场景如银行文档识别与信息提取。

Conclusion: ARL框架结合机器效率和人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用中的模型性能提升提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出TCDiff框架，用于生成高质量、多模态的电子健康记录（EHR）数据，解决现有方法在建模复杂数据依赖和处理数据缺失方面的不足，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模、高质量电子健康记录（EHR）数据稀缺的问题，尤其是针对中医（TCM）领域，提出一种能处理多模态数据和数据缺失的新方法。

Method: 提出TCDiff（Triplex Cascaded Diffusion Network）框架，通过三个级联的扩散网络分阶段生成数据：参考模态扩散、跨模态桥接和目标模态扩散。

Result: 实验结果表明，TCDiff在不同缺失率下平均比现有方法提升10%的数据保真度，同时保持隐私保护能力。

Conclusion: TCDiff在真实医疗场景中展现出高效性、鲁棒性和通用性，为EHR数据合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为IMU的影响引导的机器学习遗忘方法，专注于仅使用遗忘数据集进行模型遗忘，避免了现有方法中对保留数据集的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受攻击且容易记忆训练数据，引发隐私泄露问题。当前大多数机器学习遗忘方法需要部分或全部微调保留数据集，这在隐私和存储方面存在问题。

Method: IMU方法通过梯度上升和动态分配遗忘强度，仅需遗忘数据集即可实现有效遗忘，同时保持模型性能。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务中，IMU一致优于现有不依赖保留数据的方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单而有效的机器学习遗忘方法，显著提高了遗忘效果并维持了模型实用性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Motivation: 针对MoE-LLMs的两个关键挑战：高内存消耗和低激活参数无法等效加速推理。

Method: 引入QESC校准量化偏差和PESF剪枝低频专家，优化内存和速度。

Result: 实验表明，方法显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度，性能损失最小。

Conclusion: EAC-MoE为MoE-LLMs的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性导致性能监控和资源管理困难，传统方法难以全面反映复杂工作负载行为。

Method: 使用USRFNet网络，分别用GNN建模服务交互和请求传播，gMLP建模集群资源动态，并将二者融合为统一系统嵌入。

Result: 在大规模压力测试中，USRFNet显著优于现有基线，提升了P95延迟的预测准确性。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和融合流量侧与资源侧特征，为微服务性能监控提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该方案通过量化技术和高效协议显著降低了MPC的计算和通信开销，为隐私保护推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott

prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.

Result: 实验显示，该方法在泛化准确性、通信成本和内存消耗上优于现有异构联邦学习框架。

Conclusion: 模型异构联邦学习框架通过特征分布交换和合成数据生成，显著提升了泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究了广义核化赌博机（GKB）中的遗憾最小化问题，提出了一种乐观算法GKB-UCB，并开发了一个新的自归一化Bernstein型不等式，证明了其遗憾界为O~(γ_T√T/κ_*)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展核化赌博机（KB）和广义线性赌博机（GLB）的框架，提出一种更通用的模型，解决现有方法无法提供紧密遗憾界的问题

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，利用新的自归一化Bernstein型不等式，结合Freedman不等式和缝合技术进行理论分析

Result: 证明了遗憾界为O~(γ_T√T/κ_*)，与KB和GLB的最优结果一致

Conclusion: GKB-UCB算法统一了KB和GLB的框架，并提供了与现有最优结果相匹配的遗憾界

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的混合分词方法，将表格数据转换为适合大语言模型训练的序列格式，并在网络入侵检测系统数据集上验证其高效性和压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据在序列架构（如Transformer和大语言模型）中的表征难题，尤其是数值与类别特征的混合编码问题。

Method: 结合预定义固定令牌表示结构元素和低基数类别特征，并使用BPE学习高基数和连续值的子词词汇表。

Result: 在NetFlow数据集（CIDDS-001）上高效处理3100万网络流，压缩比为6.18:1，生成10亿令牌的语料库。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构化数据上的基础模型训练提供了可行且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHAR是一个统一框架，将时间序列分类模型的数值特征归因转化为结构化、易读的规则，提升模型透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类的解释性差，输入空间维度高，难以直接解释原始时间序列。

Method: PHAR利用后验解释器生成规则，并通过规则融合步骤优化质量指标（覆盖率、置信度、简洁性）。

Result: PHAR在UCI数据集上提升了模型的可解释性、决策透明度和实用性。

Conclusion: PHAR解决了时间序列分类模型解释中的冲突和重叠问题，提供了清晰的领域适应性见解。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于物理信息的神经网络策略迭代（PINN-PI）框架，用于解决由二阶HJB方程控制的随机最优控制问题。通过逐步迭代和误差控制，该方法在训练过程中能评估策略质量，并展示了在多个基准问题上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决随机最优控制问题，尤其是由二阶HJB方程控制的问题，传统方法难以处理高维问题或缺乏理论保障。

Method: 在每次迭代中，训练神经网络通过最小化固定策略诱导的线性PDE残差来近似值函数，并进行系统误差控制和策略更新。

Result: 方法在随机问题（如随机倒立摆和高维LQR问题）中表现良好，并继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性。

Conclusion: PINN-PI框架为随机最优控制问题提供了理论支持和高效求解方法，适用于高维问题。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Motivation: 解决现有 CcGAN 和 CCDM 在数据不平衡和计算效率上的局限性。

Method: 提出自适应邻域机制和多任务判别器，结合 GAN 的一步生成能力。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，CcGAN-AVAR 实现了最先进的生成质量，同时推理速度快 300 倍至 2000 倍。

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR 有效解决了数据不平衡和计算效率问题，为高维数据生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: OccamVTS利用知识蒸馏从大型视觉模型中提取仅1%的关键参数，解决时间序列预测中的高参数冗余问题，提升准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉模型在时间序列预测中参数冗余严重，99%的参数不必要，甚至可能因高层语义噪声而降低预测精度。

Method: 提出OccamVTS框架，通过金字塔式特征对齐、相关性和特征蒸馏，从预训练视觉模型中提取关键1%参数到轻量网络。

Result: 实验显示，OccamVTS在多个基准数据集上实现最优性能，尤其在少样本和零样本场景表现突出。

Conclusion: 参数大幅削减反而提升预测精度，证明了时间序列任务更依赖低层次纹理特征而非高层语义信息。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Result: 实验显示AGFT节省44.3%的GPU能耗，性能延迟开销低于10%，综合能效优化达40.3%。

Conclusion: AGFT显著提升现有LLM推理集群的能效和经济效益，且不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Conclusion: FedDPQ为不可靠无线网络下的联邦学习提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中表现优异，但生成轨迹与条件协变量之间的语义不对齐问题（尤其在复杂或多模态条件下）仍待解决。

Method: 引入评分网络评估中间扩散状态与未来协变量的语义对齐，通过重要性重加权逐步调整采样路径，同时保持原始训练过程不变。

Result: 在真实世界预测任务中，该方法在预测准确性和协变量对齐方面均表现出色，尤其在复杂条件下效果显著。

Conclusion: SemGuide是一种模型无关的方法，可无缝集成到任何条件扩散框架中，有效提升协变量一致性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Conclusion: 可训练优化框架优于传统手动设计方法，计算高效且性能优异，适用于多种优化场景。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without

Result: 实验表明，策略能有效恢复部分性能损失，并在不同数据异构场景下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 策略虽不能精确重建丢失数据，但对客户端退出问题有效，未来需进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Conclusion: 结合最优控制的连续时间模型能够有效提升时间序列任务的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Lagrangian方法可能导致振荡和超调，需要更稳定的约束优化方法。

Result: 实验表明PCPO在约束优化中表现稳定，提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Conclusion: PCPO为约束下的策略优化提供了有效方法，对未来研究和应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种统一框架（干预检测器，ID），用于分析语言模型在训练过程中线性可操控性的动态变化，揭示概念在隐藏空间中的线性可分性与可操控性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解语言模型内部表示的可操控性条件，现有方法多基于试错和启发式验证，缺乏系统性分析。

Method: 采用干预检测器（ID）框架，通过隐藏状态和表示分析，结合热图、熵趋势和余弦相似性等指标，研究线性可操控性在训练中的演变。

Result: 研究发现概念在隐藏空间中的线性可分性随训练逐渐增强，且与线性可操控性的出现密切相关。不同相关概念（如愤怒和悲伤）的可操控性出现在不同训练阶段。

Conclusion: 结论是ID框架能有效揭示训练过程中线性可操控性的动态变化，且该发现在不同模型家族中具有普适性。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在大型语言模型（LLM）持续预训练中，应对数据分布偏移的两种方法：经验回放和梯度对齐。实验表明两者均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，尤其梯度对齐在LLM预训练中首次被证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统LLM预训练方法在新数据加入时需从头训练的不足，提出持续预训练以提高效率，但需解决新数据带来的分布偏移问题。

Method: 采用经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，基于Llama架构在1000亿token的多语言数据上进行大规模实验，并提出高效的MER实现。

Result: 两种方法均能稳定学习且避免遗忘；梯度对齐首次在LLM预训练中显示有效；小比例回放旧数据比增大模型规模更高效。

Conclusion: 持续预训练中，经验回放和梯度对齐能有效应对分布偏移，且小比例回放比增大模型规模更具计算优势。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Motivation: 研究神经网络内部表示的组织方式，探索是否可以无监督地找到编码不同方面信息的自然子空间。

Method: 提出邻居距离最小化（NDM）方法，以无监督方式学习非基对齐的子空间。

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释性强，定量实验表明子空间与GPT-2中的电路变量密切相关，且该方法可扩展至20亿参数模型。

Conclusion: NDM方法为理解模型内部结构和构建电路提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了GNN解释中的分布偏移问题，提升了解释的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）在现实应用中非常重要，但在部分可观察环境中学习策略的挑战在于非马尔可夫性观测。现有的自动机表示方法仅关注基于奖励的非马尔可夫性，且计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出了Transition Machines (TMs)来补充现有的Reward Machines (RMs)，并设计了Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM)作为统一的自动机表示方法。进一步提出被动自动机学习算法DB-RPNI，优化了计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，DB-RPNI在计算速度上比现有技术提升了三个数量级。

Conclusion: DBMM和DB-RPNI有效地解决了部分可观察环境中非马尔可夫性问题，并通过优化实现了显著的计算效率提升。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了高维概念空间中学习组合与特征复杂性的差异，为理解二阶方法和扩展梯度适应在少样本学习中的作用提供了路径。

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Motivation: 传统混合整数规划（MIP）方法在大型电力网络拓扑优化中计算复杂度高，难以求解。

Result: 实验显示，OptiGridML在1000个断路器的网络中，功率输出提升18%，计算时间从小时级降至毫秒级。

Conclusion: 证明了基于图神经网络的组合优化方法在物理网络系统中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

Motivation: 现有的主动特征获取方法存在训练困难或短视性问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用监督训练的潜在变量模型，通过在潜在空间中推理未观测特征的多种可能实现来进行特征获取。

Result: 在广泛的合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 潜在变量模型为主动特征获取提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型预训练语言模型在多任务微调中需要参数高效且表达能力强的适配器的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器，先通过Kronecker乘积分解冻结线性更新，再通过低秩分解压缩参数。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上测试，Kron-LoRA在参数更少的情况下表现与传统LoRA相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA结合Kronecker结构、低秩压缩和量化友好性，为多任务适配提供了可扩展且可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Result: 在数学推理任务中，推理FLOPs减少1.4至9倍且不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 早期拒绝机制显著提升大语言模型的推理计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架首次结合LLM和图检索知识提升预测能力，为医疗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: 论文提出KAFNet模型，通过改进预对齐方法（CPA）并结合预卷积、时间核聚合和频率线性注意力模块，显著提升了不规则多元时间序列（IMTS）的预测性能，同时降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不规则多元时间序列（IMTS）的不均匀采样和变量异步性难以高效建模，现有方法如零填充预对齐（CPA）带来计算负担，而图模型无法充分捕捉全局相关性，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出KAFNet模型，包含预卷积模块（平滑序列和减少稀疏性）、时间核聚合模块（可学习的压缩和建模）以及频率线性注意力模块（低成本建模频率域相关性）。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上，KAFNet实现了最先进的预测性能，参数减少7.2倍，训练和推理速度提升8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet通过改进CPA方法并结合创新模块，显著提升了IMTS预测效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散的推荐系统攻击框架DLDA，通过精细控制目标提升和生成逼真的虚假用户行为，揭示了现有推荐系统在对抗攻击下的严重脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐系统攻击模型难以同时实现强对抗性目标提升和逼真行为以避免检测，DLDA旨在填补这一空白，揭示被低估的攻击风险。

Method: DLDA利用条件潜在扩散过程在协同嵌入空间中迭代合成虚假用户配置文件，并通过分散正则化机制增强行为模式的多样性和真实性。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和五种流行推荐模型上的实验表明，DLDA比现有攻击方法更能提升目标排名且更难被检测。

Conclusion: 现代推荐系统的脆弱性被低估，亟需更强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Motivation: 现有的基于脉冲Transformer的模型需要大量参数和高计算成本，限制了其在资源受限环境中的部署。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了轻量化的ST模型。

Method: 论文引入了两种剪枝策略（非结构化L₁P方法和结构化DSP方法）来减少ST块的权重矩阵冗余，并提出了一种增强的脉冲神经元模型（sLIF神经元），通过突触和内在可塑性机制的协同学习来补偿剪枝。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，所提方法显著减少了模型大小和计算开销，同时保持了竞争力性能。

Conclusion: 论文证明了所提出的剪枝和补偿策略在构建高效且高性能的ST模型中的有效性。

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Conclusion: GRAD有效解决了动态广告需求的挑战，提升了平台性能。

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and
10.68% increase in ROI.

Conclusion: Dual-DM显著提升了安全关键场景生成的性能，证明了其在演化场景生成方法中的有效性。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

Method: 分析5,680个编码决策，结合模型的自信心和多样性量化（归一化香农熵），提出双信号评估方法。

Result: 双信号方法能几乎完全解释模型间一致性（R^2=0.979），并减少人工工作量达65%。

Conclusion: 该研究为定性研究中校准AI判断提供了可推广的证据标准。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Method: 提出了一个模型回收框架，通过高效选择和重用预训练模型的子集，支持参数高效的模型训练，适用于黑盒和白盒场景。

Result: 该框架使得模型即服务（MaaS）提供商能够构建高效的预训练模型库，实现多源无数据监督迁移学习。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决源数据不可用问题提供了一种高效方法，推动了迁移学习的实际应用。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net为未来流行病防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Motivation: LoRA在微调大型语言模型时可能导致对齐漂移，削弱安全和行为约束，因此需要一种能有效保持对齐的方法。

Method: AGL结合了任务损失监督、Fisher信息矩阵正则化和碰撞感知正则化（包括Riemannian重叠和测地线分离），以限制对齐敏感子空间的更新。

Result: 在安全关键基准测试中，AGL将对齐漂移降低了50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL是一种结构化的改进方法，能够在最小化代价的情况下有效保持对齐，适合进一步探索和应用。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Conclusion: 本研究为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Conclusion: LSTM方法能有效提升大型卡车在工作区合并的安全性。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Conclusion: PTBCC有效解决了标注稀疏性和类别不平衡问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Conclusion: 结构设计不仅是性能调优的手段，更是塑造学习动态的关键因素，为设计可扩展且可信赖的神经网络提供了指导原则。

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Method: 提出Amber Pruner，一种训练无关的N:M激活稀疏方法，针对预填充阶段的线性投影层进行优化，并结合W8A8量化框架提升效率和泛化性。

Result: 实验证明，该方法成功在多个模型和稀疏比（2:4、4:8、8:16）下实现超55%线性计算的高效削减，且在不同下游任务中保持优越性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Amber Pruner开创了激活稀疏的新领域，为下一代AI系统的算法与架构协同设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于线性代数的防御方法（FedLAD），用于抵御联邦学习中的Sybil攻击，特别是目标数据投毒攻击。该方法通过将聚合过程建模为线性代数优化问题，有效过滤恶意节点，并在实验中表现出优于五种现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习构成严重威胁，尤其是恶意节点占多数时，现有方法如聚类和鲁棒训练难以应对。因此，亟需开发新的防御机制以确保系统安全。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性问题，转化为线性代数优化任务，通过提取独立的线性组合来识别和过滤恶意节点。

Result: 实验证明FedLAD在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时，能保持低攻击成功率，并在比例为0.2至0.5时保持高模型准确性，优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: FedLAD显著提升了联邦学习系统的可靠性和性能，有效抵御数据投毒攻击，且不依赖特定应用场景。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与治疗发现之间的空白。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement

Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

Conclusion: 提出的模型通过结合MLP、MSCNN和CA，有效地提升了轨迹预测的精度，同时保持了高效的推理时间，解决了全局与局部时间信息融合的挑战。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 网络化专精LLM系统能有效提升信息准确性和响应时效，为资源受限场景提供可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Conclusion: MPFT框架为多目标强化学习提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

*Sangjun Park,Tony Q. S. Quek,Hyowoon Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pigeon-SL是一种基于鸽巢原理的新型分布式学习方案，能够在保护隐私的同时提高模型对抗恶意客户端的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割学习（SL）在边缘网络中的隐私保护和通信效率方面表现出色，但其顺序更新过程容易受到恶意客户端的影响，导致模型准确率下降。

Method: 提出Pigeon-SL方案，将客户端分为N+1个簇，独立训练并通过验证损失筛选最诚实簇；进一步提出Pigeon-SL+，提升训练和通信效率。

Result: 实验表明，Pigeon-SL在标签翻转、激活和梯度操纵等攻击模型下显著提升了准确率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络中的隐私保护和鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

*Tiantian Liu,Xiao Li,Huan Li,Hua Lu,Christian S. Jensen,Jianliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于学习的通用框架，用于在无需特定领域特征的情况下搜索最短路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Dijkstra和A*算法）在复杂图中效率低下，且索引技术需要大量预处理，而现有学习方法的通用性不足。

Method: 构建骨架图以捕获多级距离和跳数信息，并使用骨架图神经网络（SGNN）学习节点嵌入，结合LSearch和HLSearch算法进行高效搜索。

Result: 在五种真实世界图形上的实验表明，该框架在不同类型的图形上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于学习的最短路径搜索提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Motivation: 虚拟细胞建模在AI与生物学交叉领域具有潜力，但传统方法因生物系统复杂性和跨学科需求而受限。

Result: CellForge在多种单细胞扰动预测任务中优于现有方法，验证了其高效性。

Conclusion: 多智能体的协作交互能够优于直接建模挑战，CellForge为虚拟细胞建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Motivation: 为了在资源受限的边缘设备上部署大规模神经网络，FAIR-Pruner旨在通过识别并移除冗余参数来减少计算和内存开销。

Method: FAIR-Pruner利用Wasserstein距离评估单元重要性，并通过泰勒展开计算重构误差，结合差异容忍度识别冗余单元，自动优化层间剪枝率。

Result: 在ImageNet等数据集和VGG等架构上，FAIR-Pruner实现了显著的模型压缩，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner是一种高效的剪枝方法，无需微调即可自动优化剪枝率，适用于多种神经网络架构。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 航空领域因商业敏感性，难以获取全面的航班运营数据，阻碍了预测模型的发展。

Method: 采用‘Train on Synthetic, Test on Real’方法，评估四种合成数据生成器在三个预测任务中的表现。

Result: 高级神经网络（如基于Transformer的生成器）能保留94-97%的真实数据预测性能。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可促进航空分析能力的广泛使用，但需对预战术预测的准确性保持现实预期。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

TL;DR: RLVR的现有方法在奖励分配上过于粗略，CAPO通过LLM生成细粒度奖励优化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法对每个推理步骤的奖励分配不够精细，导致学习效率低下，需要改进。

Method: CAPO利用通用LLM生成过程奖励模型（LLM-as-GenPRM），提供细粒度奖励分配，并通过投票机制提升准确性。

Result: CAPO在多种模型和任务上表现优于监督学习和RL微调方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度奖励分配和投票机制显著提升了RLVR的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决边缘设备上DNN训练因大数据集和多次访问DDR带来的高能耗和泛化问题。

Method: 设计DNN-free的DE-SNE算法，利用近内存计算技术。

Result: NMS在模型精度上优于DQ、DQAS和NeSSA等SOTA方法。

Conclusion: NMS首次结合DNN-free和近内存采样技术，显著提升边缘设备训练效率。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

Conclusion: 该框架为分类问题提供了新的视角，结合动力系统与压缩理论，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

Motivation: 贝叶斯优化的性能高度依赖超参数选择，传统方法需要依赖经验或手动调整，效率低下且容易失败。

Result: 在合成基准函数和实际超参数优化任务中，BOOST表现优于固定超参数的BO方法。

Conclusion: BOOST能够自动化选择最优超参数组合，显著提升贝叶斯优化的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

Result: Gibbs采样器和HMC能正确估计不确定性，而MFVI不能；Laplace近似仅在大样本下有效。后验均值在小样本情况下优于MAP估计。

Conclusion: 后验采样在词嵌入中的应用具有明显优势，尤其是在小样本情况下，Gibbs采样器在大规模数据上也表现出可行性。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

Result: 在多种任务中表现优异，计算速度比TensorRT-FP8快20%以上，同时提升了预填充延迟和内存效率。

Conclusion: MicroMix成功结合了高效计算和高精度，为LLMs的推理优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW和FGW距离虽强大但计算复杂，现有切片方法受限多，需改进以适应实际应用。

Result: 新切片FGW显著降低计算量，保持等距不变性，适用于任意几何形状。

Conclusion: 新方法在数值上更稳健可靠，适用于形状检索和图同构测试。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL在算法交易中的短视行为和不透明策略问题，利用LLM的战略推理能力生成高层策略来指导RL。

Method: 通过LLM生成高层交易策略，指导RL代理行动，并通过专家评估和金融指标（如Sharpe Ratio和Maximum Drawdown）验证效果。

Result: LLM引导的系统在回报和风险指标上优于标准RL。

Conclusion: 混合系统结合了LLM的战略能力和RL的战术执行能力，为算法交易提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

TL;DR: PPF框架通过二级性能预测，动态高效地剪枝大型语言模型，显著提高速度并减少性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非均匀剪枝方法依赖人工设计策略，难以适应动态需求且评估耗时。

Method: PPF采用代理生成实时剪枝动作和轻量性能预测器，支持动态和静态剪枝。

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Llama3-8B上，PPF显著降低困惑度，速度提升64倍。

Conclusion: PPF自动优化剪枝策略，优于人工设计，适合动态和静态场景。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 传统谱图嵌入方法在捕捉潜在的跨域结构特征方面表现不足，需要更具表达力的嵌入方法。

Method: 提出GEFRFE方法，结合图分数域滤波和分数化图拉普拉斯矩阵特征向量的非线性组合，并采用搜索优化和ResNet18自适应学习动态确定分数阶。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，GEFRFE能捕捉更丰富的结构特征，显著提升分类性能，且计算复杂度与GEFFE相当。

Conclusion: GEFRFE通过分数域扩展显著增强了嵌入的信息量，为图表示学习提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Motivation: 标签噪声是训练深度神经网络时的常见问题，现有的对称损失函数虽能容忍噪声，但因对称条件过于严格而易导致欠拟合。

Result: 理论证明$ε$-softmax可实现噪声容忍学习，实验证明其在合成和真实标签噪声下的优越性能。

Conclusion: $ε$-softmax方法有效解决了对称损失函数的欠拟合问题，实现了鲁棒性与学习效果的更好平衡。

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端发送的故障更新可能导致全局模型性能下降，现有防御机制需要不现实的先验条件。

Result: 在病理图像分类任务中验证了ASMR的检测能力，并展示了动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR为联邦学习提供了一种无需先验知识的实用防御方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用经典机器学习和PointNet模型评估生成肝脏形状质量的方法，替代了传统的专家组评估，提高了效率并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D医学形状生成模型缺乏真实数据，使得质量评估困难，而现有的评估指标多为群体分布距离，医学领域需要个体级别的评估，通常需要专家耗时审核。

Method: 通过从生成的肝脏形状表面采样点云数据，提取手工几何特征，训练监督ML和PointNet模型，分类肝脏形状为‘好’或‘坏’。

Result: ML分类器不仅提供可解释性反馈，还补充了专家评估的不足，可作为轻量级、任务相关的质量评估指标。

Conclusion: ML分类器能支持更透明且临床对齐的评估协议，适用于医学形状建模。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架为FGL中的数据遗忘提供了一种高效且全面的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，新方法有效减少了标签噪声，提升了医学图像分析的准确性。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Conclusion: AnalogCoder-Pro为模拟电路设计提供了端到端的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Method: 利用互学习交替训练模型和逆模型，消除频繁数据传输，并通过零阶技术整合最终模型。

Result: SplitMe在资源成本和收敛性上优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed。

Conclusion: SplitMe通过互学习和资源优化，显著提升了O-RAN中联邦学习的效率和效果。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Conclusion: Jacobinet是一种高效、通用的解决方案，能够无缝集成到PINNs中，提升PDE求解的能力。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

Method: 分析多种架构，识别三种参考帧类型（集中式、分布式、双向式），并研究其在训练早期阶段的表现及架构组件（如位置编码）的影响。

Result: AS是建立高维空间稳定坐标系的最优解，其类型受架构组件（如位置编码）影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为Transformer注意力机制提供了新视角，对架构设计及AS现象的理解具有指导意义。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

Conclusion: XAI方法需要针对神经影像数据进行特定领域的调整和验证，现有研究中使用的标准XAI方法可能需要重新评估。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Result: 结果显示，基于规则的方法在性能上与现有贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的解释性。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在透明性和性能上表现出色，适用于需要高解释性的应用场景。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT策略未充分利用MoE的动态路由机制，导致性能受限，因此需要研究如何在PEFT中引入路由机制以优化MoE模型的适配效果。

Result: 实验验证了路由方法的性能和效率，识别了不同场景下的最佳配置，并为PEFT和MoE的应用提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 在PEFT中引入路由机制可显著提升MoE模型的适配效果，为相关应用提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

*Xudong Wang,Tongxin Li,Chris Ding,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARGNN框架通过学习图的连续且各向异性的黎曼度量张量场，自适应地捕捉图的复杂几何异质性，优于现有的固定曲率GNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图数据中复杂几何异质性共存的问题，克服现有固定曲率几何GNN难以捕捉多样结构的局限性。

Method: 提出自适应黎曼图神经网络（ARGNN），学习节点的局部最优几何形状，并通过Ricci流正则化平滑学习流形。

Result: 理论证明了ARGNN的几何演化收敛性，并在同质和异质基准数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ARGNN不仅能自适应捕捉多样结构，还提供了可解释的几何洞察，验证了理论分析。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

*Siyi Liu,Yujia Zheng,Yongqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对表格数据在低数据量场景下的生成问题，提出StructSynth框架，结合LLMs与结构控制，提升生成数据的结构完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中表格数据稀缺问题，传统生成方法和LLMs在低数据量时表现不佳或忽略结构依赖。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 学习DAG结构；2) 利用DAG指导LLMs生成数据。

Result: 生成数据在结构完整性和下游任务表现上优于现有方法，尤其在低数据量场景中。

Conclusion: StructSynth有效平衡隐私与数据保真度，显著提升合成数据质量。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更有效地利用用户的现场外转化数据并探索其与现场活动的联系，提升广告推荐系统的性能。

Method: 构建大规模异构图，提出TransRA模型（TransR的改进版），采用大ID嵌入表技术和基于注意力的KGE微调方法。

Result: 在CTR和CVR预测中观察到显著AUC提升，实际应用中实现了2.69%的CTR提升和1.34%的CPC降低。

Conclusion: 提出的技术创新可应用于其他大规模工业模型，显著提升广告推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

*Ali Forootani,Mohammad Khosravi,Masoud Barati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepKoopFormer结合Transformer和Koopman算子理论，提供了高维非线性时间序列的可解释、稳定预测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在噪声和动态不确定性下可解释性差和不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用模块化编码器-传播器-解码器结构，通过光谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间学习时序动态。

Result: 在合成系统、气候、金融和电力数据集上优于LSTM和Transformer模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一个灵活、可解释且稳健的高维动态预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

*Austin Rockman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过3x3卷积核和两种关键技术（CAK和AuGAN）实现从200个样本中学习音频效果，显示出对抗训练在音频变换中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用最小化数据和对抗训练来发现新的音频效果变换方法。

Method: 使用Conditioning Aware Kernels（CAK）和AuGAN技术，通过3x3卷积核实现频率相关的时间位移，产生音频效果。

Result: 学习的卷积核能产生基于输入特征的音频效果，展示了对抗训练在音频变换中的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对抗训练可以从少量数据中发现独特的音频变换，为效果设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Conclusion: LOST是一种高效且性能优异的LLM预训练方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is
