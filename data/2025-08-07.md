### [1] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动化生成虚拟现实（VR）培训内容的方法，以解决开发VR培训应用的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VR在员工培训中具有沉浸式和交互式的优势，但其开发过程仍面临时间和资源的高要求。本文旨在通过自动化生成培训内容来克服这些限制。

Method: 系统由两个核心模块组成：一个LLM模块用于从文本中提取任务相关信息，另一个智能模块将这些信息转化为VR环境中的动画演示和视觉提示。

Result: 该方法提高了培训效果并减少了开发成本，使VR培训更易于扩展和适应行业需求。

Conclusion: 通过LLM自动化生成VR培训内容，为开发高效、灵活的培训解决方案提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [2] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于极坐标的离群点检测算法（PCOD），用于提高圆形拟合的准确性，尤其在工业环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 圆形拟合方法在工业中广泛应用，但噪声点集会影响算法效果，需先检测和去除离群点。

Method: 将点集转换到极坐标，计算局部和全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别离群点。应用于工业垫圈的高精度直径测量。

Result: PCOD算法在多种圆形拟合和离群点检测方法中表现最佳，显著提升了拟合精度。

Conclusion: PCOD算法有效提升了圆形拟合的准确性，适合工业环境应用。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法，利用已知参考件提高相机测量系统的精度，将误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专用设备如远心镜头在测量窄公差零件时仍存在机械和软件相关的误差，尤其是测量不同直径零件时。

Method: 提出基于转换因子和像素的两种方法，利用已知参考件计算未知零件的直径。

Result: 实验显示，针对1-12毫米玻璃和3-24毫米金属工件，误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米。

Conclusion: 该方法通过少量参考件实现高精度测量，显著降低误差并提高可靠性。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

### [5] [Audio-Assisted Face Video Restoration with Temporal and Identity Complementary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04161)
*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GAVN网络，通过视觉和音频特征的融合，解决面部视频的多类退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉与音频特征的内在关联，尤其是嘴部区域，且多只针对压缩伪影问题。

Method: GAVN通过身份和时间互补学习，先在低分辨率空间恢复粗帧，再结合音频和面部标志在高分辨率空间恢复细节，最后整合特征生成高质量视频。

Result: GAVN在压缩伪影移除、去模糊和超分辨率任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN在多种视频退化问题上表现优异，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify and segment sound-producing
objects in videos by leveraging both visual and audio modalities. It has
emerged as a significant research area in multimodal perception, enabling
fine-grained object-level understanding. In this survey, we present a
comprehensive overview of the AVS field, covering its problem formulation,
benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and the progression of methodologies.
We analyze a wide range of approaches, including architectures for unimodal and
multimodal encoding, key strategies for audio-visual fusion, and various
decoder designs. Furthermore, we examine major training paradigms, from fully
supervised learning to weakly supervised and training-free methods. Notably, we
provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks,
highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies,
and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current
challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

### [7] [LayerT2V: Interactive Multi-Object Trajectory Layering for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04228)
*Kangrui Cen,Baixuan Zhao,Yi Xin,Siqi Luo,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerT2V是一种分层生成视频的方法，解决多物体运动轨迹控制的挑战，提升生成质量和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在多物体运动场景中表现不佳，尤其是在轨迹交叉时语义冲突严重，LayerT2V旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分层生成背景和前景物体，将各物体置于独立层级，实现多物体运动的灵活合成和控制。

Result: 实验显示LayerT2V在复杂多物体场景中表现优异，mIoU和AP50指标分别提升1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V为多物体视频生成提供了新的解决方案，显著提升了生成质量和控制能力。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了LLM4-IC8K框架，用于自动化解析PCB电路板的IC封装几何标注，解决了当前大模型在几何感知上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IC封装几何标注对PCB布局至关重要，但当前缺乏自动化方法。大模型在几何感知上表现不佳，阻碍了标注问题的解决。

Method: 提出LLM4-IC8K框架，将IC机械图视为图像，分三步进行几何解析：感知引脚数量、计算引脚中心坐标和估计引脚尺寸。采用两阶段训练（合成数据预训练和真实数据微调）。

Result: 模型在ICGeo8K数据集（8608个样本）上表现优于现有大模型，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K通过结构化的几何解析和多模态数据训练，显著提升了IC封装几何标注的自动化能力。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基准数据集上优于现有去噪方法，且在真实世界TIR数据集上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际机器人部署提供了一种高效的TIR图像去噪解决方案。

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Conclusion: 通过跨模态显著锚点的利用，该方法显著提升了弱监督条件下的时间定位效果，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

TL;DR: 研究通过比较三种计算机视觉方法（目标检测、人群分类和语义分割）以及提出一种新的线性优化方法，表明CCTV数据可以准确估计地铁站台拥挤度，从而提升运营决策和乘客体验。

Motivation: 地铁站台拥挤度的准确估计可以提升运营效率、安全性和乘客体验，但目前依赖间接代理数据（如票务数据或人工观察）且实时性不足。

Method: 比较三种计算机视觉方法（YOLOv11、RT-DETRv2、APGCC的目标检测；Crowd-ViT的人群分类；DeepLabV3的语义分割），并提出一种线性优化方法从分割图中提取计数。

Result: 在超过600小时的隐私保护视频数据集上测试，计算机视觉方法能有效估计拥挤度，CCTV数据独立使用即可实现高精度实时估计。

Conclusion: CCTV数据可用于提升地铁站台拥挤度的实时估计，为运营决策提供支持，最终改善拥挤缓解措施。

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

TL;DR: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) 用于低层次视觉任务的图像质量评估 (IQA)，现有方法缺乏对“思考”过程的奖励监督。提出的 Refine-IQA 框架通过多任务奖励函数和概率差异奖励策略提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有 RFT 方法在 IQA 任务中缺乏对“思考”过程监督的问题，并提升模型的低层次视觉感知能力。

Method: 分两阶段：1) 使用 Refine-Perception-20K 数据集和多任务奖励函数增强视觉感知；2) 引入概率差异奖励策略监督“思考”过程。

Result: Refine-IQA 模型在感知和评分任务中表现优异，并激活了强大的质量解释能力。

Conclusion: Refine-IQA 框架通过多阶段 RFT 显著提升了 IQA 任务的性能和模型能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Motivation: 高吞吐量4D-STEM数据采集中的噪声、光束中心漂移和椭圆失真问题导致定量测量偏差，传统的校正算法缺乏通用性。

Method: 使用注意力增强的U-Net和ResNet架构构建了一个端到端深度学习管道，通过大规模模拟数据集训练，实现去噪、中心校正和椭圆失真校准。

Result: 方法将去噪的平均平方误差降低50%，中心定位误差低于0.04像素，优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为4D-STEM的实时分析提供了高可靠性的自动化解决方案，支持高通量数据采集。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human

address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量、特定类别的训练视频，难以扩展到开放世界的多样音频-视频类别。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：自动预训练使用大量噪声视频学习音频-视频对齐，微调阶段仅需少量高质量视频。通过多特征条件和窗口注意力增强同步，并利用预训练的文本-视频生成器和音频编码器。

Result: 减少了10倍以上的人工标注需求，并在48类视频的新基准AVSync48上表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法高效扩展了音频同步视觉动画的应用范围，同时显著降低了成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有检测方法依赖低层特征和模型特定特性，泛化性和鲁棒性不足；而RAG方法主要在文本领域应用，视觉领域尚未充分探索。

Method: RAVID结合微调的CLIP图像编码器和VLM，动态检索相关图像并融合查询图像，形成增强输入。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中，RAVID平均准确率达93.85%，在图像退化条件下平均准确率为80.27%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVID在检测AI生成图像方面具有高准确性和鲁棒性，为视觉领域的RAG应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 营养内容图像估计对健康监测至关重要，但现有方法依赖专有数据集，限制了可重复性。

Method: 使用ImageNet和COYO预训练的ViT模型，与CNN基线模型及JFT-300M预训练模型对比，在Nutrition5k数据集上评估。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性和质量对2D营养估计的迁移学习至关重要。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: JanusNet是一种新的3D医学图像数据增强框架，通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部聚焦难分割区域，显著提升弱监督医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练样本和标注的稀缺，弱监督医学图像分割常使用数据增强方法，但现有方法破坏了3D医学图像的解剖连续性，导致结构不一致性。因此，需要一种既能保持解剖连续性又能增强难分割区域训练的方法。

Method: JanusNet通过双阶段设计实现数据增强：1) Slice-Block Shuffle步骤沿随机轴对同索引切片块进行对齐打乱，保持垂直平面的解剖连续性；2) Confidence-Guided Displacement步骤利用预测可靠性替换切片内的区块，增强难分割区域的信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上的实验表明，JanusNet显著优于现有方法，例如在仅20%标注数据的Synapse数据集上实现4%的DSC提升。

Conclusion: JanusNet通过全局解剖建模和局部难区域增强，为弱监督医学图像分割提供了一种高效的数据增强方案，适用于各种师生框架，且性能优越。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to

degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型由于联合建模时空信息导致令牌序列过长，引发校准方差高和学习困难的问题。

Method: 采用Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection构建高质量校准数据集，并利用Attention-guided Sparse Token蒸馏方法关注对输出影响更大的令牌。

Result: 在W4A6量化下，实现了无损性能，同时模型压缩3.9倍，推理加速1.3倍。

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT有效解决了视频扩散模型的量化挑战，为高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在主动检测输入错误方面的能力，提出了输入审查能力评估框架（ISEval），发现当前模型依赖提示且表现因错误类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMMs是否能主动检测和审查错误输入，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 提出了ISEval框架，包含七类缺陷前提和三种评估指标，对十个先进LMMs进行了广泛评估。

Result: 发现模型普遍依赖提示，识别逻辑错误较易但语言错误较难，且对不同模态的信任度不同。

Conclusion: 强调需增强LMMs主动验证输入的能力，为解决问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种原型驱动的结构协同网络（PDSSNet）来解决遥感图像语义分割中的高类内方差和类间相似性问题。通过三个关键模块实现语义和结构信息的协同，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在遥感图像语义分割中，高类内方差和类间相似性导致传统方法难以完整分割地物。现有的类引导方法也因粗糙的原型表示和忽略目标结构信息而受限。

Method: PDSSNet包含三个模块：自适应原型提取模块（APEM）确保语义准确性；语义-结构协同模块（SSCM）结合全局语义和局部结构信息；通道相似性调整模块（CSAM）动态调整类间判别特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，PDSSNet在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过协同语义和结构信息，显著提升了遥感图像分割的完整性和准确性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示学习在图像分类任务中表现良好，但在图像-文本检索任务中面临挑战，尤其是细粒度属性和类似子类别的区分问题。

Method: 提出了DCAR框架，联合优化属性和类别的特征，通过属性描述的动态权重更新和类别匹配的负样本引入来实现细粒度学习。

Result: 在FDRD数据集上的实验表明，DCAR优于现有基线，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合重加权策略，显著提升了图像-文本检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合单目摄像头和2D雷达点云数据的NLoS行人定位框架，解决了路边停车导致的盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路边停车导致的NLoS盲区威胁道路安全，尤其是行人突然出现的场景。现有方法依赖预定义空间信息，实用性和泛化性不足。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停放车辆，结合深度估计和2D雷达点云数据进行精确空间推断。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升行人早期检测能力，改善道路安全。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态停车场景下的NLoS行人定位问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2推动了无监督域适应Object ReID的边界，为后续研究提供了基础。

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

TL;DR: SPJFNet通过自挖掘内源性先验和高效频率处理，显著提升暗图像修复的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗图像修复方法依赖外部先验、多阶段冗余操作和频率域全局计算，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出SPJFNet，引入自挖掘引导模块（SMGM）和双频引导框架（DFGF），优化频率处理以减少计算复杂度。

Result: SPJFNet在多个评测基准上性能领先，且显著降低了模型复杂度和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过内源性先验和高效频率处理，解决了暗图像修复的效率和性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试存在模拟与现实差距、任务复杂度不足和推理覆盖不完整等问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过构建基于第一人称操作视频的数据生成流程，整合任务选择、图像对提取、自动化注释和问题生成，结合人工验证，创建高质量数据集。

Conclusion: VisualTrans揭示了现有模型在时间建模和因果推理方面的不足，为开发更强大的VTR系统提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Conclusion: 分离动作与身份不仅可行且具有优势，为手语视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角对象对应是视觉理解的关键但困难的任务，现有方法难以兼顾位置和语义关系。

Method: 提出DOMR框架，包括Dense Object Matcher模块和掩码细化头，联合建模视觉、空间和语义线索。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D基准测试中，DOMR的mIoU分别达到49.7%和55.2%，比之前方法提升5.8%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DOMR通过整合位置和语义关系，显著提升了跨视角对象匹配的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GPI-WT，一种基于全局可预测插值（GPI）的白盒Transformer框架，用于k-space插值，显著提升了插值准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有k-space插值方法（如卷积神经网络）主要依赖局部可预测性，忽略了k-space的全局依赖性。Transformer在自然语言处理和图像分析中表现出色，但在k-space插值中缺乏可解释性。为解决这一问题，作者提出了GPI-WT。

Method: 通过将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，并利用结构化低秩（SLR）模型的子梯度推导出可学习的注意力机制，GPI-WT将SLR优化算法展开为一个级联网络，构建了首个专为加速MRI设计的白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验结果表明，GPI-WT在k-space插值准确性上显著优于现有方法，同时提供了更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT通过结合SLR模型和Transformer，成功解决了k-space插值中的全局依赖性问题和可解释性问题，为加速MRI提供了可靠的新方法。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档修复对数字化、分析和可读性至关重要。现有方法多为独立任务模型，复杂且难以扩展。Uni-DocDiff旨在统一多任务修复并提升扩展性。

Method: 提出可学习的任务提示设计确保扩展性，开发Prior Pool结合局部高频和全局低频特征，设计Prior Fusion Module自适应选择任务相关先验信息。

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff提供了一种高效、可扩展的文档多任务修复解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and

*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCSAFormer，解决Transformer在医学图像分割中计算复杂度高和局部特征捕获不足的问题，通过压缩注意力模块和双分支前馈网络提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在医学图像分割中表现优异，但存在计算复杂度高和局部特征捕获不足的局限性。

Method: 采用压缩注意力模块（CA）降低计算复杂度，并引入双分支前馈网络（DBFFN）增强局部特征捕获能力。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上优于现有方法，同时保持较低计算开销。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhaochen Liu,Kaiwen Gao,Shuyi Liang,Bin Xiao,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma,Tingting Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了O-Bench，第一个专门为遮挡感知设计的视觉问答基准，揭示了当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类在遮挡感知上的显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的基石，但当前MLLMs在这一领域的表现尚未充分研究，因此需要专门的评估工具来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于SA-1B数据集，通过分层合成方法构建了1,365张语义连贯的遮挡图像，并标注了4,588个问答对，形成O-Bench基准。

Result: 评估22种MLLMs后发现，模型缩放或思维过程无法显著缩小与人类基线的差距，并识别了三种典型失败模式。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并有望推动MLLMs在视觉智能方面的发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积的渐进式特征融合解码器网络TNet，通过简单操作实现全局与局部特征的整合，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割网络多关注局部特征交互，忽略了多分辨率间的全局依赖关系，TNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用ResNet-18编码器和TNet解码器，通过卷积与加法操作逐步融合低分辨率全局特征与高分辨率局部特征。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen、Potsdam和LoveDA数据集上分别取得了85.35%、87.05%和52.19%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TNet通过渐进式特征融合有效提升了分割性能，同时保持了高效计算。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

Motivation: 解决现有方法（如图像上采样或视频超分辨率）未能显式保证3D一致性的问题。

Method: 结合3D高斯喷溅场景表示和2D超分辨率模型，确保空间一致性。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据集上生成高分辨率且3D一致的视觉结果。

Conclusion: 3DSR在提升分辨率的同时保持了3D结构一致性，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏视角下难以实现精确几何重建，且传统平滑方法会破坏关键边缘和纹理。

Result: 在稀疏视角新视角合成任务中，DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS通过统一框架解决了稀疏视角重建的关键挑战，提升了结构的准确性和视觉质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEARL-CLIP是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的新型跨模态交互框架，通过动态生成跨模态查询和正交技术，提升了医学图像分析的性能，同时保持了参数高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据有限，通用视觉语言模型（如CLIP）直接应用于医学领域存在显著的领域差距，需要通过跨模态交互和知识解耦来优化。

Method: 提出了NEARL-CLIP框架，包含USEformer（动态跨模态查询）和OCA（正交解码器）两个模块，以促进模态间交互和新知识获取。

Result: NEARL-CLIP通过仅引入1.46M可学习参数，实现了多模态医学领域知识的相互增强和模态对齐。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP在参数高效的情况下成功提升了医学图像分析的性能，为跨模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Motivation: 人类感知研究能够补充计算机视觉模型的定性评估，但传统研究方法复杂且难以扩展。增强现实（AR）为研究者提供了新的机会。

Method: 设计了ARCADE平台，支持跨平台AR数据收集、通过可插拔模型推理的自定义实验协议，以及用于用户研究的AR流式传输。

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMSeg 是一种新型框架，利用多模态大模型（MLLM）的视觉编码器细节特征，避免额外视觉编码器的引入，并通过DSFF模块和轻量级掩码解码器，在性能与成本间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前参考表达式分割（RES）方法要么依赖参数繁重的SAM模型，要么牺牲准确性使用轻量化流程。MLLMSeg旨在解决性能与成本之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，充分利用MLLM视觉编码器的细节特征，设计DSFF模块融合视觉细节与语义特征，并构建轻量级掩码解码器（34M参数）。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMSeg优于基于SAM和无SAM的竞争对手，实现了性能与成本的更好平衡。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过创新设计和轻量化实现，为RES任务提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is
available at https://github.com/jcwang0602/MLLMSeg.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在车辆再识别和人物搜索任务中均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle框架有效解决了车辆检测与再识别的联合学习问题，并在新构建的基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SSD-Net展示了单尺度特征提取在水下图像增强中的潜力，为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角深度监督和自适应损失设计，为医学图像分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Method: 使用Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner生成结构化文本描述，结合多模态检索完成分类。

Result: 在12个基准测试中表现优于现有少样本CLIP方法和部分全监督MLLM方法。

Conclusion: UniFGVC在少样本细粒度视觉分类中具有优异的泛化和兼容性。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

*Lijuan Liu,Wenfa Li,Dongbo Zhang,Shuo Wang,Shaohui Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDC-Net是一个统一的几何感知扩散模型，能够同时生成RGB图像和深度图，并通过联合学习框架增强空间和几何对齐，实现精确的相机轨迹控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常将RGB和深度生成分开处理，缺乏联合学习框架以增强几何一致性。IDC-Net旨在解决这一问题，通过联合生成RGB-D视频序列，提升相机控制的精确性和几何保真度。

Method: 提出了IDC-Net，一个统一的几何感知扩散模型，通过联合学习框架生成RGB图像和深度图。构建了一个相机-图像-深度一致性数据集，并提供几何感知的Transformer块以实现精细相机控制。

Result: 实验表明，IDC-Net在生成的场景序列的视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法，且生成的RGB-D序列可直接用于下游3D场景重建任务。

Conclusion: IDC-Net通过联合学习框架成功提升了RGB-D序列生成的几何一致性和相机控制精确性，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICM-Fusion的新框架，结合元学习和上下文适应，优化任务向量方向以减少多任务损失和增强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练LoRA融合方法在处理多任务时易引发权重冲突和领域遗忘，尤其在少量样本场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出ICM-Fusion框架，通过任务向量算术动态平衡优化方向，并利用Fusion VAE重构融合LoRA。

Result: 实验表明ICM-Fusion能显著减少多任务损失，并在少量样本场景下实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion在多任务适应和泛化能力方面优于现有方法，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个包含6300个真实世界模因帖子的数据集，分两阶段标注，并提出标签生成模块，显著提升有害内容检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体模因常传播有害内容，但数据获取和标注成本高，阻碍了内容审核技术的发展。

Method: 创建两阶段标注的数据集，并提出标签生成模块，增强模因上下文信息。

Result: 实验显示，加入标签后显著提高了有害内容检测的性能。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态在线环境中的内容审核提供了新颖且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在专业异常检测领域表现受限，现有方法存在数据利用率低和推理过程监督不足的问题。

Method: 提出了多阶段推理过程和精细奖励机制，优化模型响应多样性和推理分析能力。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了模型对细微异常的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了通用模型与专业需求之间的鸿沟，为工业异常检测提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

TL;DR: U2CLLIE是一个结合不确定性增强与空间-颜色因果建模的新型框架，通过熵基不确定性和层次因果建模解决低光图像增强中的噪声和梯度消失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低光图像增强方法通常忽略了特征表示中的不确定性，尤其是在极暗条件下，梯度退化和噪声主导会严重影响模型的可靠性和因果推理。

Method: 1. 不确定性感知双域去噪模块（UaD）利用高斯引导自适应频域特征增强（G2AF）抑制噪声并优化特征表示。2. 层次因果感知框架通过亮度增强网络（LEN）和两个不对称因果建模模块（NeCo和AsC）构建约束。

Result: U2CLLIE在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能，表现出鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了低光图像增强中的不确定性问题和因果建模挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 傳統RPCA模型在計算負擔、超參數調校和動態場景適應性上存在局限，需改進以提升效能與解讀性。

Method: 通過將鬆弛的RPCA模型結構化為包含BAM、OEM和IRM的網路，並引入MAM和DCPM增強特徵保存與物件提取。

Result: 在多元數據集上表現卓越，達到最先進效能，並通過視覺與數值測量提升解讀性。

Conclusion: RPCANet++結合RPCA理論優勢與深度網路效率，為稀疏物件分割設定了新基準。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

Motivation: 生物医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的训练数据可能包含隐私信息和错误知识，导致部署后隐私泄露或错误输出。由于完全重新训练成本高昂，机器遗忘成为潜在解决方案。目前缺乏评估生物医学MLLMs遗忘效果的数据集。

Method: 提出了MLLMU-Med基准，通过新颖的数据生成管道将合成的隐私数据和事实错误整合到训练集中。设计了两种关键场景（隐私保护和错误知识移除），并提出遗忘效率评分（Unlearning Efficiency Score）量化遗忘效果。

Result: 评估了五种遗忘方法，发现它们在去除生物医学MLLMs中的有害知识上效果有限，表明仍需改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为生物医学MLLMs的遗忘问题提供了首个基准，并揭示了现有方法的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Motivation: 传统的视频文本视觉问答方法存在冗余文本实体和隐式关系建模问题，限制了准确性和效率。

Method: GAT模型包含两个模块：上下文聚合实例聚集模块（整合视觉、布局和文本信息）和实例聚焦轨迹追踪模块（捕捉文本的动态演变）。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了GAT的有效性，其准确率比现有方法高3.86%，推理速度比视频大语言模型快十倍。

Conclusion: GAT在视频文本视觉问答任务中表现出色，为准确性和效率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谱聚类是一种主流的聚类方法，但其优化过程不连贯且表示能力有限。本文旨在通过端到端模型解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了BootSC，通过单一网络联合学习谱聚类的所有阶段（相似矩阵构建、谱嵌入和k-means聚类），并利用最优传输监督和正交化技术。

Result: 实验证明BootSC在聚类性能上达到最佳水平，例如在ImageNet-Dogs数据集上NMI提升了16%。

Conclusion: BootSC通过端到端设计和创新技术，显著提升了谱聚类的性能。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Method: ViFP构建子问题模板，通过多轮QA构建有效推理路径，动态分析推理一致性，并引入自适应CoT机制。

Result: 在A-OKVQA等数据集上，ViFP将准确率提升5.4%，FP数量显著减少。

Conclusion: ViFP不仅提升推理准确性，还能有效检测和减少FP，为视觉推理提供了可靠的定量评估工具。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption

several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在非稳态数据上的持续学习面临跨模态对齐和泛化能力退化的问题，亟需系统性研究。

Conclusion: 本文为开发终身视觉语言系统提供了全面参考，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Conclusion: PIS3R为大视差图像拼接提供了高精度解决方案，适用于下游3D视觉任务。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %
Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon

TL;DR: 本文通过系统性地研究直接微调（DFT）方法在持续语义分割（CSS）中的遗忘问题，发现预训练视觉模型（PVMs）具有内在的抗遗忘能力，并提出了一种简单的改进方法DFT*，其在性能上优于现有复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续语义分割（CSS）的目标是增量学习新类别的同时保留旧类别的知识。现有研究认为直接微调（DFT）容易遭受严重的灾难性遗忘，但本文质疑这一假设，试图揭示PVMs的真实抗遗忘能力。

Method: 通过两大标准基准（Pascal VOC 2012和ADE20K）和两种PVM主干（ResNet101和Swin-B），作者详细分析了DFT的遗忘问题，并基于发现提出了DFT*方法，包括冻结主干和旧分类器、预分配未来分类器等策略。

Result: 实验表明，DFT*在性能上优于16种现有方法，同时所需的可训练参数和训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: PVMs的抗遗忘能力被低估，DFT*作为一种简单高效的方法，为持续语义分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: 提出的PKSS-Align方法鲁棒性强，适用于实际应用中的多样化点云配准问题，且无需复杂训练或编码。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a

Conclusion: LATR模型通过长度先验和查询分组策略显著提升了TSG任务的性能，证明了长度信息对优化查询功能的有效性。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Conclusion: VisionTS++为跨模态知识迁移开辟了新范式，推动了通用时间序列基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Motivation: DAS技术在不同领域应用中面临数据分布不均和标注数据不足的问题，限制了AI模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用自监督的掩码重建任务预训练MAEPD模型，并通过VPT技术仅微调少量参数以适应下游任务。

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有高效性、泛化性和可扩展性，为DAS领域的信号识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Method: ErasePro引入零残差约束以确保目标与锚概念特征完美对齐，并采用渐进式分层更新策略从浅层到深层逐步转移特征。

Result: 在不同概念擦除任务（如实例、艺术风格和裸露擦除）中，ErasePro展现出更高的擦除效果和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: ErasePro通过优化目标和更新策略，显著提升了概念擦除的彻底性和生成质量的保留。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Conclusion: TempFlow-GRPO 通过时间感知的优化机制显著提升了流模型的强化学习效果。

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，需要更复杂的方法从医学图像中分析心脏及其结构，以评估形态和病理，生成心脏数字孪生模型。

Method: 采用平衡联合训练方法结合CT和MR数据，并使用强化的强度和空间增强技术提升训练数据多样性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效生成精确语义分割，为心脏数字孪生模型提供支持，具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表示方法通常忽视人造环境中普遍存在的平行线等结构规律，导致参数冗余和优化效率低下。

Method: 通过将线标志物分解为全局（共享消失方向）和局部（缩放法向量）组件，并在Riemannian流形上优化，实现紧凑编码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了位姿估计和线重建的精度，同时减少了参数维度和收敛稳定性。

Conclusion: RiemanLine为3D线提供了一种高效、统一的表示方法，特别适用于结构化环境。

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了形状和反射率恢复的准确性。

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS在自然光条件下实现高保真表面形状和反射率恢复，扩展了MVPS的实用性。

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: TSPO在多个长视频理解基准上达到最先进性能，并展现了在不同Video-MLLMs中的可迁移能力。

Conclusion: TSPO有效解决了MLLMs在长视频处理中的挑战，提升了事件理解和语言生成能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

Motivation: 耳部生物特征识别因标注数据稀缺和类内变异性而受限。现有方法从单独样本提取特征，难以捕获一致且具区分性的表示。

Method: 提出ProtoN框架，通过图神经网络（PGNN）联合处理同一身份的多样本，设计双路径消息传递机制和跨图原型对齐策略，结合混合损失函数优化嵌入空间。

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中展现出优越性能，验证了其解决数据稀缺问题的有效性。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Conclusion: VITAL通过工具增强和多任务学习显著提升了视频推理性能，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，实现了计算量和推理延迟的显著降低，同时任务预测质量提升高达7.4%。

Conclusion: 该机制有效解决了多任务学习中Transformer的计算瓶颈，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Conclusion: COR任务和CORE模型为细粒度多模态检索开辟了新方向，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

Conclusion: CVC任务框架有效提升了LVLM的视觉感知能力，且无需依赖高级模型或人工协助。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

Conclusion: 4DVD在新型视图合成和4D生成中表现先进，拓展了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为QuantVSR的低比特量化模型，用于解决真实世界视频超分辨率（VSR）中扩散模型速度慢和资源消耗高的问题，通过空间-时间复杂度感知机制和可学习偏置对齐模块，显著优于其他低比特量化方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Method: 提出因果Delta嵌入，强调干预在潜在空间中的不变性和稀疏性，无需额外监督即可从图像对中学习因果表征。

Result: 在因果三重挑战实验中，因果Delta嵌入在OOD设置下表现卓越，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 专注于干预表征能够有效提升模型的OOD鲁棒性，因果Delta嵌入是一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Conclusion: RAIDX是首个统一RAG和GRPO的框架，显著提升了深度伪造检测的准确性和透明度，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要关注特征级知识转移，忽视了教师模型logit分布中的重要信息。

Method: 提出TopKD，包含Top-K Scaling Module (TSM) 和 Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL)，增强logit蒸馏效果。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有蒸馏方法，适用于多种网络架构。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logits在知识蒸馏中的潜力，是一种高效且通用的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer通过结合局部和全局特征，显著提升了PD严重程度分类性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

Motivation: 解决现有OnVTG模型缺乏有效事件建模和长时记忆能力的问题。

Method: 提出分层事件记忆框架，包括事件提案和未来预测分支。

Result: 在TACoS、ActivityNet Captions和MAD数据集上取得最优性能。

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆显著提升了在线视频时间定位的准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿和试脱任务被孤立研究，缺乏对其互补性的系统探索。研究旨在填补这一空白，提出统一框架解决两者的对称性问题。

Method: 采用双向特征解耦方法，结合潜空间和像素空间的双重条件引导，并设计分阶段训练模式，解决掩模依赖的不对称性。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在效果和性能上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: TWGTM成功统一了VTON和VTOFF任务，为解决服装图像生成中的对称问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Conclusion: OMFA为虚拟服装合成提供了一种实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Motivation: 解决LVLMs因训练数据利用不足而产生的幻觉问题。

Method: 引入POPEv2基准，通过掩码图像探究训练偏差；提出Obliviate方法，仅微调语言建模头以减少幻觉。

Result: Obliviate显著降低幻觉，且高效、可扩展。

Conclusion: 通过针对性微调，Obliviate有效减少了LVLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad
dMRI applications. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为K2Sight的框架，通过结构化语义监督将临床概念分解为可解释的视觉属性，从而在医学图像中实现高效异常定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医学领域中由于术语与视觉模式不匹配导致的性能不足问题，同时避免大规模预训练的高成本。

Method: K2Sight框架将临床概念分解为视觉属性（如形状、密度和解剖位置），并通过指令式提示进行训练。

Result: 仅使用1.5%的数据训练的小型模型（0.23B和2B参数）性能优于7B+的医学视觉语言模型，mAP50提升高达9.82%。

Conclusion: 结构化语义监督可以有效提升医学图像定位的效率，为资源有限的场景提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习框架，用于多类皮肤疾病分类，评估了三种图像预处理技术，并比较了多种预训练模型的性能。结果显示DinoV2结合RGB预处理效果最佳，准确率高达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤疾病分类由于类别相似性高、变异大且纹理复杂，具有挑战性，需要高效的预处理和模型选择。

Method: 研究系统评估了RGB、CMY颜色空间转换和CLAHE三种预处理技术，并比较了DenseNet201、Efficient-NetB5和多种transformer模型的性能。

Result: DinoV2结合RGB预处理表现最佳，准确率达93%，且Grad-CAM可视化显示其能准确定位病变区域。

Conclusion: 有效的预处理和模型选择对于构建稳健且可解释的皮肤疾病CAD系统至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长序列处理上表现不佳，且依赖慢速的测试时优化和深度传感器。为了解决这些问题，作者希望通过深度估计和3D高斯映射改进重建质量与效率。

Method: 将深度估计器集成到RGB-D SLAM系统中，利用3D高斯映射解决深度预测的几何细节问题，并结合前馈循环预测模块直接从光流推断相机位姿。

Result: 在Replica和TUM-RGBD数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能与SplaTAM相当，同时追踪时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过快速网络推断取代慢速优化，显著提升了在线3D重建的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

TL;DR: OmniDepth通过双向对齐单目和立体深度估计的潜在表示，结合两者的优势，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目和立体深度估计各有优劣，但实践中两者通常独立使用。OmniDepth旨在融合两者的优势，解决各自的局限性。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的跨注意力对齐机制，动态同步单目的上下文线索和立体的假设表示，通过迭代双向对齐优化深度估计。

Result: OmniDepth在Middlebury和ETH3D数据集上将零样本泛化误差降低了40%以上，且在透明和反射表面等挑战场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过融合多视图几何和单目上下文，实现了超越单一模态局限的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

Motivation: 探索双侧耳对称性对CNN学习特征的影响，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 开发耳侧分类器自动区分左右耳，并在训练和测试中利用侧耳信息，通过跨数据集实验验证效果。

Result: 分离左右耳处理显著提升了CNN耳识别的性能，消融实验提供了训练大规模数据集的实际建议。

Conclusion: 双侧耳对称性对CNN耳识别系统有显著影响，实际应用中应分离处理左右耳以提高识别率。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 当前模型在图表理解基准上的进步未能全面反映视觉推理能力的需求，需更系统地评估和改进。

Method: 提出EncQA基准，基于可视化文献设计，包含2,076个合成问题-答案对，覆盖6种编码和8种任务，评估9个先进模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同编码和任务间差异显著，模型规模未带来预期提升。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解需针对特定视觉推理差距的策略，而非简单扩大模型或数据集。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Conclusion: PixCuboid通过优化学习高效特征，提升布局估计性能，并具有灵活性。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，输出质量仅轻微下降（GenEval评分下降2.6%，HPSv2评分下降7%）。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune显著优化了模型资源消耗，同时保持了生成图像的感知质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

Motivation: 现有提示调优方法在面对弱语义扰动（如图像或文本噪声）时表现脆弱，影响了模型对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: 提出ANPrompt框架，通过融合噪声文本特征构建噪声提示，并将其与可学习提示令牌结合生成抗噪声提示；同时计算噪声抵抗视觉提示原型，并通过多目标损失函数（包括弱语义噪声对齐损失）优化模型。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过创新性地处理弱语义扰动，为视觉语言模型的提示调优提供了更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统的端到端训练复杂且依赖人工设计，需要更高效的训练框架。

Method: TurboTrain结合多智能体时空预训练和平衡多任务学习策略，减少人工干预。

Result: 在V2XPnP-Seq数据集上验证，TurboTrain提升了SOTA模型的性能。

Conclusion: 预训练有效捕获时空特征，平衡学习策略优化任务表现。

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

TL;DR: BEVCon是一个简单但有效的对比学习框架，用于提升自动驾驶中的BEV感知能力，通过两个对比学习模块优化特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究多关注BEV编码器和任务头优化，忽视了表示学习的潜力。

Method: 提出BEVCon框架，包含实例特征对比模块和视角对比模块，结合检测损失实现密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实验显示，BEVCon性能显著提升，mAP达到+2.4%。

Conclusion: BEVCon证明了表示学习在BEV感知中的重要性，为传统任务优化提供了补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多帧3D占用时空特征聚合的高处理成本和不确定性挑战。

Method: 提出ST-Occ框架，包含时空记忆和不确定性感知的注意力机制。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中优于现有方法3 mIoU，减少29%的时间不一致性。

Conclusion: ST-Occ有效提升了时空一致性，适用于自动驾驶的精细环境建模。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

TL;DR: LUST框架通过多模态分析视频内容，结合视觉和听觉信息，利用两阶段评分机制量化用户定义的主题相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是提供一个能理解视频内容并量化其与用户描述主题相关性的系统，帮助用户快速定位重要片段。

Method: 采用多模态分析管道，结合视觉和语音识别信息，通过LLM分两阶段评分（直接相关性和上下文相关性）。

Result: 输出带有可视化相关性评分和分析日志的标注视频，提供更细致的主题相关性评估。

Conclusion: LUST框架能有效识别并量化视频内容的主题相关性，满足用户需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a
framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance
of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of
significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating
visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a
hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language
Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses
individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the
theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that
refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding
thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST
framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined
significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores
and comprehensive analytical logs.

Method: 提出Ref-Thinker多模态语言模型，结合指令微调数据链生成对象描述，显式提示Grounding-DINO和SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在标准Ref-AVSBench和新R²-AVSBench上取得最优结果。

Conclusion: TGS-Agent通过显式推理和多模态分析，提升了分割任务的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at

Result: 在RECOLA和AGAIN两个情感数据集上，PriCon模型表现优于传统LUPI和端到端模型，甚至接近全模态训练模型的性能。

Conclusion: PriCon为缩小实验室与真实环境间的差距提供了可行方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹压缩方法通常局限于2D轨迹，忽略时间同步和运动连续性，无法满足多维轨迹的压缩需求。

Method: PILOT-C 通过独立压缩每个空间轴，将频域物理建模与误差限制优化结合，支持任意维度的轨迹压缩。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，PILOT-C 在压缩比上平均优于CISED-W 19.2%，误差平均减少32.6%，3D压缩比提升49%。

Conclusion: PILOT-C 在多维轨迹压缩中表现优异，为高效轨迹压缩提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory
data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a
common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time
synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory
compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,
the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型在CXR诊断中依赖“一次性”方法，缺乏对推理过程的监督，导致长推理、稀疏奖励和频繁幻觉等问题。CX-Mind旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 构建了指令调优数据集CX-Set（708,473张图像和2,619,148个样本），生成42,828个高质量交替推理数据点，采用基于课程的强化学习（CuRL-VPR）分两阶段优化推理过程。

Conclusion: CX-Mind通过可验证的推理过程和基于课程的优化，在多任务CXR诊断中展现了显著的临床实用性和性能提升。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在预训练中保留的不准确或过时信息会导致推断时的错误或偏见输出，现有编辑方法难以同时编辑大量事实且可能损害模型的通用能力。

Method: 引入Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS)，通过轻量级超网络操作特定实体的潜在知识，实现大规模精确编辑。

Result: 在Llama-2和Mistral上的实验表明，即使同时编辑数量达10,000，LKS仍能有效进行知识编辑并保留模型的一般能力。

Conclusion: LKS证明了通过编辑内部表示实现大规模知识编辑的可行性，且不会损害模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information
from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during
inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge,
they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously
and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our
empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal
representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing
natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent
Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of
specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and
large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even
with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs
knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

Motivation: 多维数据补全在计算机视觉等领域至关重要，现有方法存在计算成本高或参数调优困难的问题，因此需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出LRTuckerRep模型，通过Tucker分解统一全局低秩和局部平滑性建模，并采用自适应加权核范数和参数-free的拉普拉斯正则化。

Result: 实验表明，LRTuckerRep在高缺失率下的图像修复和交通数据补全任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep通过结合两种先验，显著提升了多维数据补全的性能。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 该工作为降低贝叶斯建模门槛提供了新工具，并展示了在多智能体系统中应用的前景。

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian
inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation
process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel
framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale
this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that
translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions,
data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize
this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable
generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture
Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical
properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where
Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions
induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation
algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed,
context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work
provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the
barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

Conclusion: 该方法在未知环境中实现了高效的分布鲁棒性能，具有理论和实践的双重价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: GTPO克服了GRPO的缺陷，提供了一种无需参考模型的更优策略优化方法。

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering
modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.
Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface
current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while
significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep
learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our
evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of
the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The
dataset and source code will be released on

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a
complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of
soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological
features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal
concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to
account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our
method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the
number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially
structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模不断扩大，参数高效微调（PEFT）变得尤为重要，但现有理论分析有限，尤其是对LoRA方法。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入Bernoulli-LoRA框架，使用伯努利概率机制选择更新的矩阵，涵盖多种变体（如GD、SGD等），并在非凸和凸非光滑函数下分析收敛性。

Result: 理论上证明了各变体的收敛性，实验验证了方法的实用性，为PEFT提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: Bernoulli-LoRA不仅扩展了现有方法，还通过理论分析和实验验证推动了PEFT领域的发展。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and
extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic
Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach
encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while
maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from
non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our
framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,
Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and
Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.
Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing
convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.
Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a
step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT
methods.

TL;DR: SNBO是一种新的基于神经网络的贝叶斯优化方法，通过分离探索和开发标准，避免模型不确定性估计的计算负担，从而在高效性和性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化（BO）在高维和大规模函数评估时面临计算复杂性挑战，基于神经网络的BO方法虽具扩展性，但依赖复杂的模型不确定性估计。

Method: 提出SNBO方法，不依赖模型不确定性估计，通过独立标准添加新样本并自适应控制采样区域，实现高效优化。

Result: SNBO在10至102维的测试问题中，性能优于四种先进基线算法，且需要少40-60%的函数评估次数，运行时间至少减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: SNBO在保持高性能的同时显著提升了计算效率，为高维黑匣子优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the
runtime by at least an order of magnitude.

Result: DP-NCB在理论和实验中均表现出色，实现了最优纳什遗憾并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DP-NCB为设计隐私保护且公平的老虎机算法提供了理论基础，适用于高敏感场景。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

Conclusion: 可分段训练的VAE-DNN在非线性PDE求解中表现出显著优势，有望成为更优的替代模型。

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

A key challenge for learning models from data streams is capturing relevant

predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
prediction-oriented approach performs better than a previously proposed

requires careful model design.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training

significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we
develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning,
featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable
training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and
phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of
turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as
a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy
consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a
central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for
personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous
effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support
decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our
approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two
control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting
interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for
longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a
constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state
features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource
constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,
including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world
therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work
establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.
We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical
improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level
violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and
multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the
mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer仅通过预测下一个token训练时学习算法能力，发现达到一定模型规模和训练集规模阈值后，模型能从上下文中学习转移概率而非单纯记忆训练模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在仅通过预测下一个token训练时，是否能学习上下文中的算法能力，尤其是对随机转移矩阵的Markov链的预测能力。

Method: 通过建立随机转移矩阵的Markov链，训练Transformer预测下一个token，并在训练和测试中使用不同的矩阵。

Result: 发现Transformer在达到一定规模和训练集规模阈值后，可以从上下文中学习转移概率；更复杂的状态编码能提升模型对未见过结构的预测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Transformer能够通过学习而非记忆来处理算法任务，其能力与模型规模、训练数据及状态编码方式相关。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving
their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up
Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to
predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different
and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set
size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition
probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns.
Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more
robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen
during training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FairPOT框架，通过选择性调整风险评分分布来解决公平性与AUC性能之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗、金融、刑事司法）中，公平性与AUC性能的平衡是一个关键挑战。作者旨在通过优化运输方法选择性调整评分分布，以解决这一矛盾。

Method: 提出了Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT)，一种模型无关的后处理框架，通过选择性地调整弱势群体的风险评分分布（如调整前λ分位数）来实现公平性与AUC性能的平衡。

Result: 在合成、公开和临床数据集上的实验表明，FairPOT在全局和部分AUC场景中均优于现有方法，并能以轻微AUC损失或甚至性能提升实现公平性改进。

Conclusion: FairPOT计算高效且易于部署，为实际应用中的公平性与性能平衡问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 开发一种高效的替代模型，模拟气泡动力学，以克服传统数值求解器的计算成本问题。

Method: 结合PI-DeepONet框架与Rowdy自适应激活函数，优化高频特征表示，并测试单步与两步训练技术。

Result: 模型在多种气泡动力学场景中表现良好，显示出作为替代模型的潜力。

Conclusion: BubbleONet为气泡动力学模拟提供了一种计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map
pressure profiles from an input function space to corresponding bubble radius
responses. BubbleONet is built upon the physics-informed deep operator network
(PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation
capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity
provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent
spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive
activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency
features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1)
Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial
radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training
techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that
BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble
dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
numerical solvers.

TL;DR: PrivCLIP是一种动态、用户可控的隐私保护传感框架，通过多模态对比学习实现用户隐私偏好的灵活调整和敏感活动的少样本检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代传感系统中用户隐私偏好多样且动态变化的问题，特别是在IMU传感器设备中，传统静态隐私保护方法适应性不足。

Method: 采用多模态对比学习将IMU数据与自然语言描述对齐，结合语言引导的数据清洗和运动生成模块（IMU-GPT）进行隐私保护。

Result: 在多个活动识别数据集中，PrivCLIP在隐私保护和数据效用方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PrivCLIP为动态隐私保护提供了一种高效、用户可控的解决方案，适用于IMU传感器设备。

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

TL;DR: TC-LoRA通过文本级和参数级解决多任务环境中LoRA适配器的任务干扰问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多任务设置中，合并来自异构源的LoRA适配器常导致任务干扰，降低下游性能。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA，通过文本级聚类和参数级的CP分解，减少任务间干扰。

Result: 在零样本和技能组合任务中，TC-LoRA在Phi-3和Mistral-7B上分别提升1.4%和2.3%准确率。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA有效解决了任务干扰问题，提升了LLM的适应能力。

Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models
(LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small
task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为DCFL的新框架，通过解耦对比学习的损失函数来解决联邦学习中数据异构性和有限样本的问题，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中，数据异构性导致性能下降，而现有对比学习方法的渐进假设在有限样本场景中不成立，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: DCFL框架将对比损失解耦为对齐性和均匀性两个目标，独立校准吸引和排斥力，避免了渐进假设的限制。

Result: DCFL在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准基准测试中，表现优于现有联邦学习方法，实现了更好的正样本对齐和负样本均匀性。

Conclusion: DCFL为联邦学习环境中的对比学习提供了一种有效解决方案，显著提升了性能，特别适用于小数据量的客户场景。

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

Motivation: 探讨两种框架的编程范式、开发者体验及实际应用中的差异，帮助从业者选择最适合的工具。

Method: 通过对比编程范式、训练速度、推理性能、部署灵活性和生态系统支持等维度进行分析。

Result: TensorFlow具备更成熟的生产环境生态系统，而PyTorch在研究中更受欢迎，因其简单灵活。

Conclusion: 两种框架各有优劣，选择应根据具体需求：研究倾向于PyTorch，生产环境倾向于TensorFlow。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative
analysis

Motivation: 时间序列数据集的异质性导致领域偏见，严重影响了时间序列基础模型的泛化能力，但目前这一问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 采用联邦学习范式，提出FeDaL方法，通过分布式架构分解异质数据集，并引入域偏见消除（DBE）和全局偏见消除（GBE）机制。

Result: 在8个任务的真实数据集上进行了广泛评估，对比了54个基线模型，验证了FeDaL的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: FeDaL有效解决了时间序列数据的异质性问题，提升了模型的泛化性能，并分析了联邦学习中数据量、客户端数量等因素对性能的影响。

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

Conclusion: QTFT证明了在NISQ设备上实现的可行性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit
depth.

Conclusion: 微调方法在小数据量下对闭源模型更有效，而开源模型需依赖合成数据提升性能，且效果可能受领域影响。

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了联邦学习中潜在驱动的多目标后门威胁的严重性，亟需新的防御策略来应对。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视图聚类方法主要关注性能，忽略了公平性这一关键问题。尽管近期研究探讨了多视图聚类中的群体公平性，但多数方法依赖于敏感属性与聚类结构的对齐，这在实践中可能失效并影响性能。

Method: AFMVC通过对抗训练从特征中去除敏感信息，并通过KL散度将视图特定的聚类分配与公平不变的共识分布对齐。

Result: 实验表明，AFMVC在公平性上优于现有方法，同时保持竞争性的聚类性能。

Conclusion: AFMVC为多视图聚类中的公平性问题提供了理论保证和实际解决方案。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive
experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC
achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been
released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and
New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions
with respect to non-adaptive approach.

*Neng Kai Nigel Neo,Lim Jing,Ngoui Yong Zhau Preston,Koh Xue Ting Serene,Bingquan Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于预训练的分子生成方法，通过结合MIST编码器和MolForge解码器，显著提升了从质谱数据生成分子结构的准确性，相比之前方法有十倍改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从质谱数据直接生成分子结构是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务。传统方法效果有限，因此需要一种更高效的方法来提升准确率。

Method: 采用MIST作为编码器将质谱转化为分子指纹，再用预训练的MolForge作为解码器将指纹转化为分子结构。通过阈值化指纹概率，优化了结构的恢复效果。

Result: 该方法在分子结构恢复上表现优异，top-1准确率达28%，top-10达36%，比之前方法提升了十倍。

Conclusion: 这种组合方法为质谱数据下的分子结构生成提供了一个强大的基线，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

Method: 采用分层交替优化策略（SAMT），结合元学习的自适应步长选择。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出更优的泛化性能和更少的参数更新。

Conclusion: SAMT在神经网络优化中具有显著效果和潜力。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

Method: 提出Causal Reward Adjustment (CRA)，通过稀疏自编码器提取PRM内部可解释特征，并利用后门调整法校正混杂变量。

Result: 实验表明，CRA能有效缓解奖励欺骗，提高数学问题解决的准确性，且无需修改策略模型或重新训练PRM。

Conclusion: CRA是一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，能够显著提升外部推理系统的性能。

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

Result: 提出了S$f$-AC算法，在分布逼近和MuJoCo实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: 对称散度可以在BRPO框架中实现，S$f$-AC证明了其在实际任务中的竞争力。

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy
optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods
focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized
policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric
divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur
numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of
$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained
with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be
decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding
the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric
$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric
divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo
verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners
for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML
approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture
search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight
models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us
to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a
large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS
achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time
horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for
time series forecasting.

Method: 使用2100张颈动脉超声图像及数据增强，结合五个预训练模型提取特征，通过浅层网络进行角度估计。

Result: 最佳模型的平均绝对误差（3.9°~9.4°）低于临床阈值，避免速度值误判。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在多普勒角度自动估计中具有潜力，可集成到超声设备软件中。

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Conclusion: T3Time通过动态多模态融合机制，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性和适应性，尤其在少样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/

Method: 提出了一个名为Mockingbird的框架，通过让LLMs扮演角色并反思错误来适应任务。

Result: Mockingbird在常见机器学习任务中表现尚可，但仅靠自身反思效果不如结合专家反馈或特定领域文档。

Conclusion: LLMs在机器学习任务中具备潜力，但需结合专家反馈或领域知识以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as
chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code
in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning
capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable
potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general
machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such
potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to
general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on
several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is
instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve
itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine
learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common
machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot
outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human
experts.

Conclusion: VL-DAC展示了简单RL算法在廉价模拟器中训练VLMs的潜力，并能有效提升现实任务的性能。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into
coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current
vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)
efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom
tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training
simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on
dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce
Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,
hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens
while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our
knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple
decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable
convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at
a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies
that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic
control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning),
and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general
image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a
simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while
delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and
web-navigation benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前机器遗忘方法在精确性、稳定性和跨领域适用性方面存在挑战，因此需要一种更高效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）遗忘阶段通过最大化输出对数与聚合伪标签的KL散度实现高效遗忘；2）对比学习阶段通过自监督方式在特征空间中区分遗忘数据与保留数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在遗忘效果和性能损失方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WSS-CL方法在监督和自监督场景下均表现出色，为机器遗忘提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in
a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning
approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies
frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining
stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we
introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image
classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to
focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called
weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine
unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the
performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes
kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels
for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning
stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using
scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten
and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the
paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples
act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental
evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning
efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised
settings.

Motivation: 为了解决SFT过程中数据质量对模型性能的限制，作者提出了一种标记分类方法。

Method: 将语料库中的标记分为正面和负面两类，正面标记正常训练，负面标记则通过遗忘机制处理。

Result: 实验表明，这种遗忘机制不仅提高了模型性能，还增强了回答的多样性。

Conclusion: 分类和遗忘负面标记是一种有效的优化SFT的方法，能够明确知识边界并提升模型表现。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large
language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire
domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their
general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data
quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance
gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate
such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts
-- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve
model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas
negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be
explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to
learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge
boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We
conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this
forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also
facilitate more diverse model responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端机器学习服务（MLaaS）在处理敏感客户数据时存在隐私问题，现有隐私推理方法在隐私和效率之间存在权衡。

Method: PrivDFS将输入特征在客户端划分为多个共享，分发给不共谋的服务器进行独立推理，并通过安全聚合重构预测结果。此外，提出了PrivDFS-AT和PrivDFS-KD两项扩展以增强隐私。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CelebA上的实验表明，PrivDFS在保持隐私性的同时显著降低了客户端计算开销（高达100倍），且无准确率损失。扩展方法在对抗攻击中表现出色。

Conclusion: PrivDFS在隐私保护和计算效率方面取得了显著改善，适用于对隐私要求较高的云端推理场景。

Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot
observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in
quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and
fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We
present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of
simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting,
enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant
time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines
enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents
overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several
synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at
uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's
versatility.

Conclusion: 该方法能适应数据分布的变化，为疾病诊断中的动态数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

### [188] [FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04405)
*Hao Zhang,Aining Jia,Weifeng Bu,Yushu Cai,Kai Sheng,Hao Chen,Xin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexQ是一种新型的INT6量化框架，通过算法创新与系统优化，在保持FP16精度的同时，显著提升推理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的高内存和计算成本限制了其实际部署。尽管现有的INT4/INT8量化降低了成本，但通常以牺牲精度为代价。INT6量化在精度和效率之间提供了更好的平衡，但缺乏现代GPU的硬件支持。因此，需要一种方法能够在不影响精度的情况下高效实现INT6量化。

Method: FlexQ采用统一的6位权重量化，并通过层敏感度分析自适应保留8位激活。为了最大化硬件效率，开发了支持W6A6和W6A8表示的专用GPU内核，利用二进制张量核心（BTC）等效实现高效矩阵乘法。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上的评估显示，FlexQ的困惑度增加不超过0.05，表明其保持了接近FP16的精度。专用内核在LLaMA-2-70B线性层上相比ABQ-LLM平均加速1.39倍。整体上，FlexQ比SmoothQuant实现了1.33倍的推理加速和1.21倍的内存节省。

Conclusion: FlexQ通过结合算法优化和硬件支持，成功实现了高效的INT6量化，为LLM的部署提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail
significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical
deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they
often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a
superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks
hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision
arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.
The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on
LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference
acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released
at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了2020年至2024年初关于多模态模型可解释性的研究，发现注意力技术是主要解释方法，但评估方法缺乏系统性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态学习和XAI的发展，需要系统分析多模态模型的可解释性研究，以推动透明和负责任的人工智能。

Method: 通过多维度分析（如模型架构、模态组合、解释算法和评估方法）对文献进行系统综述。

Result: 研究集中在视觉-语言和纯语言模型，解释方法多为注意力技术，但评估方法不一致且忽视模态特定因素。

Conclusion: 建议推动标准化评估和报告实践，以支持未来可解释、负责任的多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years,
particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to
significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this
progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred
a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making
processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research
published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the
explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we
examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model
architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation
methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are
concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based
techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these
methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between
modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity
across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in
multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,
robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual
factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of
recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized
evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to
support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible
mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate
the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in
deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate
that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial
attacks in the domain of recommender systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于云模型的生成模型CMCFAE，通过集成云模型到WAE框架中，利用云模型的特征函数规范潜在空间，提升复杂数据分布的建模能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖标准高斯先验和传统散度度量，可能导致重构样本均质化，而云模型提供更灵活、真实的潜在空间表示。

Method: 在WAE框架中引入云模型的特征函数作为正则化器，利用云模型先验改进潜在空间的表示。

Result: 在MNIST等数据集上的实验表明，CMCFAE在重构质量、潜在空间结构和样本多样性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CMCFAE不仅提出了云模型与MMD正则化的新结合，还为基于自编码器的生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a
novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein
Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the
cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate
modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely
on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method
employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic
representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed
in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud
model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in
terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample
diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model
theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new
perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

*Roman Belaire,Arunesh Sinha,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于层次强化学习的新方法，通过多轮对话策略训练AI，以更有效地发现LLM的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的自动化测试方法依赖脆弱的模板或单轮攻击，无法模拟现实中的复杂对抗对话，因此需要更动态、多轮的方法。

Method: 将红队测试建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并采用层次强化学习框架，结合细粒度的token级奖励，训练生成代理。

Result: 该方法在多轮攻击策略中表现出色，能够发现现有基线方法忽略的细微漏洞，成为新的最优方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法将LLM红队测试重新定义为动态、基于轨迹的过程，为AI的稳健部署提供了关键支持。

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in
current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to
capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We
propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI.
By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a
hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the
inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns
coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm
reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing
baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing
LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step
test) essential for robust AI deployment.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在小规模任务切换场景中，传统方法（如MLP和LSTM）与基于注意力机制的架构（如Transformer）的性能对比。结果显示，标准Transformer无法解决一个基于有限域算术的任务切换问题，而其他模型表现相似但平庸。唯一的成功方案是结合非平移不变架构（cisformer）和扩展注意力机制（extensive attention），其性能显著提升至95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在小规模应用中，基于注意力机制的模型是否能超越传统方法（如MLP和LSTM），尤其是在任务切换场景下。通过实验揭示了注意力机制的局限性及其改进潜力。

Method: 使用任务切换框架（基于IARC子任务：增量、加法、反向复制和上下文），比较了标准Transformer、LSTM、MLP、cisformer和扩展注意力模型的性能。

Result: 标准Transformer无法解决基础任务切换问题，其他模型表现平庸。仅非平移不变架构（cisformer）与扩展注意力组合达到95%的高性能。

Conclusion: 在任务切换场景下，注意力机制的表现可以通过非传统架构和扩展注意力显著改进，这有助于更深入理解注意力机制的工作原理。

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely
based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive
small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform
traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks.
We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework
models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined
by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard
transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on
finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment /
addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long
short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our
comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer
architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and
an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the
latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance
levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can
be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different
formulations in task-switching settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 介绍了一种名为CARD的缓存并行推测解码框架，通过解耦草稿和验证步骤，显著提升了LLM的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法受限于‘草稿-验证’顺序执行模式，导致效率低下且限制了草稿模型的规模。需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CARD框架采用‘查询-修正’模式：草稿模型生成候选词填入共享缓存，目标模型并行修正，实现高速推理。

Result: 与普通解码相比，CARD实现了最高4.83倍的加速效果，且无需微调模型。

Conclusion: CARD通过并行化解码过程，显著提升了LLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate
solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of
Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations,
profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies
overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical
details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale
problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term
rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we
propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces
simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations
and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based
\textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate
physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via
convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale
information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical
features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show
that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\%
relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale
simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent
paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while
simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL
methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data
heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders
convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in
the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently
sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the
research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized
Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)
solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend
of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,
we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To
support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our
FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic
global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form
solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless
of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP
scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%
in accuracy.

Method: 采用基于英格兰全国代表性住房数据的因果机器学习模型，分析墙体保温的平均和条件处理效应。

Result: 干预措施平均减少燃气需求（高达19%），但高能源负担群体几乎无节能效果，因其倾向于将节能用于提高热舒适度而非减少消费。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁建立更广泛的评估框架，兼顾气候影响和家庭能源政策的公平性。

Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel
poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly
heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally
representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and
conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing
on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions
reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden
groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy
burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a
behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income
ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort
rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent
rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential
co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader
evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity
implications of domestic energy policy.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种更全面的模型评估方法，其Python实现将开源。该方法强调了错误的层次性和重要性，适用于需要精细评估的场景。

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a
sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes
localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.
Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by
counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the
ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as
equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy
with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or
operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure
exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a
given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground
truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions
instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of
misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in
complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class
labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The
scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees
that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors
discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer
granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an
approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many
errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of
the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of
publication.

Conclusion: 因果反思框架通过动态建模和反思机制，提升了代理的因果推理能力，为未来的研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的Transformer和CNN模型在多元时间序列分类中计算负担重、频率多样性有限且需要大量参数。PRISM旨在解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 结合经典信号处理与现代深度学习，PRISM为多元时间序列分类提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from
wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances,
Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer
limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We
propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a
convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric
finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales,
independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields
highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions,
greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage
and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads,
matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using
roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical
signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate,
resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

Conclusion: Fed-CI实现了高效、隐私合规的联邦交通预测，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has
become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,
traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy
constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for
traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on
designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information
from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such
approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting
transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume
of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,
making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for
federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).
Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client
communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate
predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop
Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to
process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information
loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI
significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy
regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and
federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,
and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.

*Haoran Niu,K. Suzanne Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究通过分析5000多个身份盗窃和欺诈案例，构建了一个基于图的身份生态系统模型，预测个人数据的隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人和组织在缺乏对隐私风险基本了解的情况下难以保护个人信息，因此需要量化隐私风险的研究。

Method: 构建了一个身份生态系统图模型，节点代表个人身份信息属性，边代表属性间的暴露关系，并利用图神经网络预测风险。

Result: 模型能有效预测某一身份属性暴露是否可能导致其他属性暴露。

Conclusion: 研究为隐私风险量化提供了有效工具，有助于更好地保护个人信息。

Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal
information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By
analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research
identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures
occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an
Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes
represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges
represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the
probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another).
Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework
that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of
further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results
show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the
disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of
another attribute?

Motivation: 传统GFM在跨域泛化中主要关注节点特征，而忽略了图结构的泛化能力。研究发现图结构能提供更一致的跨域信息。

Result: 实验表明，GraphProp在监督学习和少样本学习中显著优于其他方法，尤其在处理无节点属性的图时表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过强调结构泛化，GraphProp在跨域图分类任务中展现了更强的泛化能力和性能优势。

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong
generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification.
Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across
different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent
cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,
traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various
domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural
cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which
emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp
consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting
graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend
only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the
graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract
structural information and provide discriminative graph representations
comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the
representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a
comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and
graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our
experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the
competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in
handling graphs without node attributes.

Result: 神经网络能准确预测动态位移和焊点生长，支持钢材到铝材的焊接阶段迁移，具有工业应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业应用提供了一种快速、基于模型的质量控制解决方案。

Abstract: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white
in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality
metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential
for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were
investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from
experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in
aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data
into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we
introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic
displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in
function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a
custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to
counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we
introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via
a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure
physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model
was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining
computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training
strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one
dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The
two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within
the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from
steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based
quality control in industrial applications.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种通用的任务无关替代方案，潜力显著。

Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions
that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To
enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time
variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge
probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach
enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling
multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants
not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative
models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and
inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling,
suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized
models.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this
paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an
efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an
adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type.
Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When
Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible
mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while
preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual
learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced
catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore,
simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity,
highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across
diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying
mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time
series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,
i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this
paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,
CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to
effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural
causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle
the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with
a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a
periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive
experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently
outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with
enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: 预训练和多专家混合框架有效解决了链接预测中的关键挑战，显著提升了性能和适应性。

Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance
recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision
from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor
generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution
to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a
pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level
information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the
transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to
effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the
diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate
experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse
downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient
tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets
with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two
domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining
competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x
lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in
supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for
thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer
learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively
on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with
self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new
source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art
performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms
specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having
almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained
species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for

Motivation: 解决在高斯分布和对抗性标签噪声下学习单索引模型的问题，尤其是在未知激活函数的情况下，现有方法无法实现常数因子近似或仅适用于较小的激活函数类别。

Method: 开发了一种优化框架，通过直接利用问题结构、高斯空间特性和单调函数的规律性，识别出一种有用的向量场来指导算法更新，避免了传统梯度方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过创新的优化框架，论文成功扩展了可学习的激活函数类别，为单索引模型的学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to
the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial
label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient
algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation,
that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded
moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta > 0.$ This class in particular includes
all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like
(possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation
either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a
substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our
approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the
boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector
field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem
structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种重要性感知的多粒度融合模型（IMG），用于视频时刻检索（VMR），动态选择性地聚合音频-视觉-文本信息，解决现有方法忽视音频或有噪音频干扰的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VMR方法主要关注视觉和文本模态，忽略音频模态的补充作用。少数尝试联合音频-视觉-文本推理的方法未能实现细粒度交互，且音频可能包含噪声。

Method: 提出IMG模型：1）设计伪标签监督的音频重要性预测器；2）多粒度音频融合模块局部、事件和全局级融合；3）跨模态知识蒸馏解决推理时音频缺失问题。

Result: 构建新数据集Charades-AudioMatter，实验验证模型有效性，达到当前音频-视频融合的VMR方法最优性能。

Conclusion: IMG通过动态选择音频融合和跨模态蒸馏，显著提升VMR性能，为多模态融合提供新思路。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically
related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.
