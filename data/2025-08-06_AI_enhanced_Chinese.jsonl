Online learning,\nsocial, and work activities, such as distance education, videoconferencing,\ninterviews, and talks, have led to a dramatic increase in speech-rich video\ncontent. In contrast to other video types, such as surveillance footage, which\ntypically contain abundant visual cues, speech-rich videos convey most of their\nmeaningful information through the audio channel. This poses challenges for\nimproving content consumption using existing visual-based video summarization,\nnavigation, and exploration systems. In this paper, we present VisAug, a novel\ninteractive system designed to enhance speech-rich video navigation and\nengagement by automatically generating informative and expressive visual\naugmentations based on the speech content of videos.

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions.

NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

Due to the impracticality of large-scale\nreal-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most\nstudies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity\nraw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce\nrealistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV\nscenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale\nefficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic\nLiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from\nmicroscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives\n(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the\nspatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index).

Accepted to the ICCV 2025 Workshop on\n  Vision-based Industrial InspectiON (VISION)", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing\ndiffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\%\nhigher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP\nestimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem.

Unlike prior methods that emphasize\nlip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking\nscenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance\ncapturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the\nrhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled\ngeneration pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that\npredicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a\nlong temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis\nmodule that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By\noperating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and\nidentity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures\nlong-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a\ndiffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich\nmotion prediction without error accumulation.

Unlike\nstandard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place\nlearnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.\nWhile they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in\nunsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a\ncomparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised\nfault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,\neach based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,\nFourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder\n(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating\ndata across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault\nDetection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest\noverall FDR ($\\geq$92\\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top\nperformer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.\nEfficientKAN-AE reaches $\\geq$90\\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating\nrobustness in low-data settings.

Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection\nare either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against\ntransformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive\nGradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG\nis neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large\ntransformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a\nunified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original\ncontributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments\nconducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the\nefficacy of AFOG.

In this paper, we propose\nMulti-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs\ncoarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain\nshifts.

However, representing scenes requires a\nlarge number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting\npractical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian\nmodels but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the\nscene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression\nquality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,\na method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering\nquality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least\nsignificant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective\npruning and redundancy reduction.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies.

Our theoretical\nanalysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently\nfinds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total\nVariation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence.

In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,\na Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D\nmedical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch\narchitecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency\ndomains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to\npreserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency\ndomain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global\ncontextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency\ndomain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D\nmulti-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and\nglobal cues.

Existing approaches typically\nfollow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;\nsecond, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates\nfrom the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent\nstudies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow\nmodels with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the\nneed for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the\nform of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban\ndata exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from\nlanguage, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both\npretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,\na framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding\nprocess over urban regions.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on\nkey words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward\ndenoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the\nvalue model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value\nmodel is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and\nenabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric\nframework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two\ncore designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a\nfrozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy.

Directly applying\nexisting CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to\nthree key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders\noverlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,\nresulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data\naugmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The\nprimary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the\nability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive\nrepresentation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its\nco-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,\nwe introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework\nwith semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised\nlearning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a\nstructure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of\nconventional methods.

CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the\npotential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support\nearly-stage drug safety assessment.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation.

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis.

Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason\nabout higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,\nenabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives.

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process.

As a result, researchers have attempted to\nadapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing\nextra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues.

In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup.

We validate our method on two leading T2V\nmodels, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%\nand 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full\nmodels.

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct\nthe egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic\ndata, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches\nindividually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial\nprecision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented\nintermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more\nstable model adaptation to the target domain.

Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of\naggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.\nFurthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL\nframework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating\nfull model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and\naggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical\nobservation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the\noutput projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning.

Current low-light image enhancement\n(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping\nnetworks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling\nunder extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on\nsimplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention.

Specifically, to address vision token\nredundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an\nenhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining\ncompatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and\neffectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise\nbackward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.\nExtensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit\nsettings.

Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric.

It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,\nplanning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles\nand effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies\ncorrectness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming\nconventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries\nof the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific\nabilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time\nscaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on\ntheir functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and\nnon-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller\nparameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical\ntasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts\nand complicated reasoning.

To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on\nslot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural\narchitectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation\nframework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a\nlightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns\ncorresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no\nadditional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of\nSlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating\nthat integrating additional losses is redundant.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the\napprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further\ndemonstration.

This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and\nimputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of\ncross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To\naddress heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC\nfirst standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional\nunification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.\nUnlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,\nIMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a\nchannel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high\nresolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach\nsimulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal\ninstabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for\nrobust signal alignment during inference.

However, despite\ntheir practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with\ndifferent stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step\nregimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and\nanalyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely\nsensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative\nstrength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is\nintrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and\ncauses exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay.

To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera\nframework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus\n(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one\ndefocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We\nuse the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,\nso as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise\ndemoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to\naddress any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and\ndefocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the\ndemoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional\ntraining loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step\ninvolves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the\nCNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely\noutperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u62cd\u6444\u805a\u7126\u548c\u6563\u7126\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6563\u7126\u89c6\u9891\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u805a\u7126\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u53bb\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6CNN\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u53cc\u8fb9\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u8272\u8c03\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u53bb\u9664\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8272\u8c03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u540c\u6b65\u62cd\u6444\u805a\u7126\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7eb9\u7406\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\uff09\u548c\u6563\u7126\uff08\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u4f46\u6a21\u7cca\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6d41\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6CNN\u7ed3\u5408\u6563\u7126\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u5bfc\u53bb\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8054\u5408\u53cc\u8fb9\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u533a\u5206\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and\naccelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous\nnoise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our\nframework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous\nmotion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated\nvideo clips.

Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related\narchitectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,\nDyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95\nacross 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed\ndatasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\\sim$11.1M\nparameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale\nvariance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust\nsolution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and\nautonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "DyCAF-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u878d\u5408\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "DyCAF-Net\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u5747\u8861\u9888\u90e8\u3001\u53cc\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDyCAF-Net\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548cmAP\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DyCAF-Net\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting.

To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation.

However, their high computational cost and large\nparameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these\nissues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We\nintroduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with\nthe weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an\nAdaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or\noutlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating\nthe impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX\nunder various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,\nand sDCI datasets.

Conversely, DAG and\nTAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles\nand venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects\ndistinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive\nmarker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep\nlearning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy\ncohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes\nindependent of disease status or treatment effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8840\u6e05\u8102\u8d28\u4e9a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8102\u8d28\u4e9a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8840\u7ba1\u5f62\u6001\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8840\u7ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8102\u8d28\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8840\u7ba1\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8840\u7ba1\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u5fd7\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7fa4\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8840\u6e05\u8102\u8d28\u4e9a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528BH-FDR\u6821\u6b63\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "result": "FA\u4e0e\u8840\u7ba1\u5f2f\u66f2\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0cCE\u4e0e\u52a8\u9759\u8109\u5e73\u5747\u5bbd\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800cDAG\u548cTAG\u4e0e\u8840\u7ba1\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8840\u7ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5faa\u73af\u8102\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4ee3\u8c22\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u8102\u8d28\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats.

While prior research has leveraged machine learning\nbased techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such\napproaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally\nintensive.

In this paper, this limitation is addressed by\nproposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse\nbuilding distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine\nlearning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are\nfirst used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain\nbuildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The\nremaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation\nalgorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test\nsections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6\ninch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency\ncompared to conventional segmentation-only approaches.

In\nthis paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate\nnoise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the\nlimitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality.

While recent\nadvances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action\nrecognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points\nto track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a\nnovel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational\ntokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling\nstrategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and\nsemantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that\ncaptures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented\nDisplacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action\npatterns.
